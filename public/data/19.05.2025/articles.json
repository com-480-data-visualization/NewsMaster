      "description": "• Diplomat says military dialogue aimed at making truce ‘sustainable’ • ISPR DG believes ceasefire can ‘hold easily’ • Confirms CBMs from both sides • Says Indian policy on Kashmir not working ISLAMABAD: A ceasefire reached between Pakistan and India following days of military confrontation does not have an expiry date, officials from both countries confirmed, putting to rest the speculations that the truce would lapse this weekend unless renewed. Rumours of a Sunday deadline gained traction after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistan’s Senate last Thursday that the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) from both sides had agreed during a May 14 conversation to extend the ceasefire until May 18 . Media outlets then widely reported that the ceasefire was set to expire. However, officials from both sides clarified on Sunday that no DGMO talks were scheduled for the day and that the ceasefire, originally brokered through intensive US diplomacy, remained in force without a set end date. “There is no expiry date to the break in hostilities, as reaffirmed in the DGMOs interaction of May 12,” an Indian official said, countering speculations of an imminent breakdown. There was no official statement from the Pakistan Army, but a diplomat on the condition of anonymity said the ceasefire remained in effect and carried no set time frame for expiration. He said the discussions of the DGMOs were aimed at “making the ceasefire sustainable”. The May 10 ceasefire came after the most serious escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours in over two decades, with cross-LoC shelling, drone incursions, and air force strikes pushing both sides to the brink. The United States, led by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, played a key role in mediating the truce, with support from Saudi Arabia. Initial violations were reported on the day following the ceasefire. But since then, military commanders have engaged in constructive dialogue. The May 12 call between Pakistan’s Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah and India’s Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai focused on reinforcing mutual commitments to avoid any aggressive or hostile actions, officials said. In that conversation, the two sides had agreed to begin a phased reduction of forward deployments and regular troops along the international border, restoring the usual peacetime arrangement where the border is manned primarily by Pakistan’s Rangers and India’s Border Security Force. Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said both DGMOs “have maintained periodic contact since May 10” and agreed to develop a structured mechanism for de-escalation. While Islamabad views the ceasefire as a potential stepping stone toward broader peace talks on long-standing issues like the Kashmir dispute and water rights, India has taken a more rigid stance. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the ceasefire as a “temporary pause,” and Defence Minister Rajnath  Singh declared that “Operation Sindoor is not over yet … Pakistan is on probation”. ‘Ceasefire will hold easily’ In comments underscoring Pakistan’s stance, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry told Arab News that the ceasefire was holding. The DG ISPR also reiterated Pakistan’s longstanding position on Kashmir, warning that the dispute remains a flashpoint unless resolved through dialogue. “As far as Pakistan army is concerned, this ceasefire will hold easily and there have been confidence-building measures in communication between both the sides,” he said. “If any violation occurs, our response is always there … but it is only directed at those posts and those positions from where the violations of the ceasefire happen. We never target civilians. We never target any civil infrastructure.” Conflict potential persists On a separate, the Pakistani military spokesman also warned of far-reaching consequences if India attempts to follow through on threats to cut Islamabad’s share of the Indus River water system. Last month, New Delhi unilaterally suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty , blaming Pakistan for a deadly militant attack in Indian-Occupied Kashmir, an allegation Pakistan denies. “Their policy on Kashmir — of oppression and trying to internalise it — is not working,” he said. “Till the time Indians don’t sit and talk about Kashmir, then (as) two countries sit, and we find a solution to it, the conflict potential is there.” “I hope that time doesn’t come, but it will be such actions that the world will see and the consequences of that we will fight for years and decades to come,” the army spokesperson said. “Nobody dares stop water from Pakistan.” The waters treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has survived multiple wars between the two neighbours and is considered one of the most successful water-sharing agreements globally. Its potential unravelling adds a dangerous new tier to an already volatile regional equation. Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",

      "title": "Questions raised over Rs2.2bn vehicle spending in FBR reforms",
      "description": "• Planning Commission urges review of expenditure amid austerity measures • FBR defends procurement of 179 vehicles, says it’s essential to operational needs across terrains ISLAMABAD: The Planning Commission has raised concerns over the procurement of 179 vehicles , including 15 fully bulletproof units, under the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) Rs41 billion Revenue Raises Project, urging a review of the Rs2.237bn expenditure in light of the Finance Division’s austerity measures. Funded by a $150 million World Bank loan at an annual interest rate of 2.5 per cent over 30 years, the project is a cornerstone of the Prime Minister’s FBR transformation plan. Despite its strong economic indicators — boasting benefit-cost ratios of 42 to 70 and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 130pc to 195pc — the Planning Commission flagged lax scrutiny in its implementation, particularly regarding vehicle procurement. “An amount of Rs2,237.5m has been proposed for procurement of 179 vehicles of different makes at a unit cost of Rs12.5m for Digital Enforcement Units without provision of specifications of vehicles,” the Planning Commission pointed out and demanded its rationalisation “in light of austerity measures of Finance Division”. The FBR, however, defended the procurement, claiming it was essential to operational needs across varied terrains, where the digital enforcement stations would be established. “The proposed vehicles represent the minimum essential specifications necessary for effective field operations, with no inclusion of luxury features. The selection strictly adheres to functional utility for anti-smuggling activities,” the revenue authority said. The project is expected to be completed in June 2027. The estimated cost savings from the project’s investments in information communication technology (ICT) hardware, taking into account the project’s investment in the new equipment and the associated operational and maintenance costs, would have been estimated at $100m in nominal terms. This investment in FBR’s data centre and network equipment has been described as unavoidable in averting the failure of the organisation’s ICT systems. “If the FBR does not invest in these upgrades soon, it will incur costs of around $200m to rebuild the data centres,” the FBR advocated. The Planning Commission noted that the end-of-period target for time spent on customs clearance at the border is set at 48.5 hours against the baseline of 97.5 hours. It said the project’s benefit-cost ratio ranges from 42 to 70, and the internal rate of return from 130pc to 195pc. The programme, originally envisaged in 2017, aims to achieve a 17pc tax-to-GDP ratio, which still struggles at about 10pc — well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3pc. The change in the base year of national accounts will further reduce Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio. Some studies observed that 64pc of economic activities are undocumented, leading to a loss of billions of rupees in tax collection, the Planning Commission observed, adding that the country’s tax system was overregulated, with the large number of taxes stifling businesses. “The cost of documentation of tax compliance even for a small business is around Rs250,000,” the Planning Commission said and noted that cash circulation in Pakistan was 28pc compared to 18pc in India and 17pc in Bangladesh. The Planning Commission called for reforms aimed at simplifying tax procedures, reducing the number of levies, and accelerating the digitisation of the tax system to integrate it with broader economic activity. The project also envisages mobile tax facilitation services, initiatives for improved taxpayer compliance, establishing a forum for technical consultations with provincial tax authorities on tax harmonisation, staff capacity-building, bac­k­up power equipment upgradation, and control rooms and monitoring systems. The FBR has recently adopted Strategic Plans for the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) and Pakistan Customs. Key components of the transformation plan include value chains’ digital transformation, introduction of tracking technology, implementation support for digital transformation, and value chain implementation support. In addition, 37 digital enforcement stations will be equipped with hard and soft interventions to counter smuggling. Out of these 37 stations, 24 will be established on the Indus and Hub rivers and surrounding areas to work as a protective wall, supported by three mobile enforcement units. Additionally, 10 stations will be set up at strategically located checkpoints in Balochistan. The Customs Tracking System will be integrated with existing databases, which would be important in identifying and targeting people or vehicles involved in transporting smuggled goods on which duties and taxes have not been paid. The FBR expects its reform efforts to generate an additional $81bn by the end of fiscal year 2028-29. The project also covers replacement of end-of-life ICT equipment, cloud infrastructure, updated software licences, data warehousing, business intelligence tools, and complete LAN and VoIP connectivity for field offices. As part of the Rs2.237bn allocation, the FBR will also procure 350 bulletproof jackets and helmets for operational personnel.

      "translatedTitle": "Questions raised over Rs2.2bn vehicle spending in FBR reforms",
      "translatedDescription": "• Planning Commission urges review of expenditure amid austerity measures • FBR defends procurement of 179 vehicles, says it’s essential to operational needs across terrains ISLAMABAD: The Planning Commission has raised concerns over the procurement of 179 vehicles , including 15 fully bulletproof units, under the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) Rs41 billion Revenue Raises Project, urging a review of the Rs2.237bn expenditure in light of the Finance Division’s austerity measures. Funded by a $150 million World Bank loan at an annual interest rate of 2.5 per cent over 30 years, the project is a cornerstone of the Prime Minister’s FBR transformation plan. Despite its strong economic indicators — boasting benefit-cost ratios of 42 to 70 and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 130pc to 195pc — the Planning Commission flagged lax scrutiny in its implementation, particularly regarding vehicle procurement. “An amount of Rs2,237.5m has been proposed for procurement of 179 vehicles of different makes at a unit cost of Rs12.5m for Digital Enforcement Units without provision of specifications of vehicles,” the Planning Commission pointed out and demanded its rationalisation “in light of austerity measures of Finance Division”. The FBR, however, defended the procurement, claiming it was essential to operational needs across varied terrains, where the digital enforcement stations would be established. “The proposed vehicles represent the minimum essential specifications necessary for effective field operations, with no inclusion of luxury features. The selection strictly adheres to functional utility for anti-smuggling activities,” the revenue authority said. The project is expected to be completed in June 2027. The estimated cost savings from the project’s investments in information communication technology (ICT) hardware, taking into account the project’s investment in the new equipment and the associated operational and maintenance costs, would have been estimated at $100m in nominal terms. This investment in FBR’s data centre and network equipment has been described as unavoidable in averting the failure of the organisation’s ICT systems. “If the FBR does not invest in these upgrades soon, it will incur costs of around $200m to rebuild the data centres,” the FBR advocated. The Planning Commission noted that the end-of-period target for time spent on customs clearance at the border is set at 48.5 hours against the baseline of 97.5 hours. It said the project’s benefit-cost ratio ranges from 42 to 70, and the internal rate of return from 130pc to 195pc. The programme, originally envisaged in 2017, aims to achieve a 17pc tax-to-GDP ratio, which still struggles at about 10pc — well below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3pc. The change in the base year of national accounts will further reduce Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio. Some studies observed that 64pc of economic activities are undocumented, leading to a loss of billions of rupees in tax collection, the Planning Commission observed, adding that the country’s tax system was overregulated, with the large number of taxes stifling businesses. “The cost of documentation of tax compliance even for a small business is around Rs250,000,” the Planning Commission said and noted that cash circulation in Pakistan was 28pc compared to 18pc in India and 17pc in Bangladesh. The Planning Commission called for reforms aimed at simplifying tax procedures, reducing the number of levies, and accelerating the digitisation of the tax system to integrate it with broader economic activity. The project also envisages mobile tax facilitation services, initiatives for improved taxpayer compliance, establishing a forum for technical consultations with provincial tax authorities on tax harmonisation, staff capacity-building, bac­k­up power equipment upgradation, and control rooms and monitoring systems. The FBR has recently adopted Strategic Plans for the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) and Pakistan Customs. Key components of the transformation plan include value chains’ digital transformation, introduction of tracking technology, implementation support for digital transformation, and value chain implementation support. In addition, 37 digital enforcement stations will be equipped with hard and soft interventions to counter smuggling. Out of these 37 stations, 24 will be established on the Indus and Hub rivers and surrounding areas to work as a protective wall, supported by three mobile enforcement units. Additionally, 10 stations will be set up at strategically located checkpoints in Balochistan. The Customs Tracking System will be integrated with existing databases, which would be important in identifying and targeting people or vehicles involved in transporting smuggled goods on which duties and taxes have not been paid.

      "description": "NEW DELHI:  In light of the ceasefire reached between Pakistan and India last week after days of hostilities, demands are growing in India to reopen the Kartarpur corridor to allow devotees to visit the shrine of Guru Nanak in Pakistan, reports said on Sunday. The demands gain heft from the permission granted to truckers, carrying perishables from Afghanistan, to cross into India from Pakistan via Wagah. After the Pahalgam attack, India shut down the Wagah-Attari border crossing, a move reciprocated by Pakistan. The officiating Jathedar of Sri Akal Takht Sahib, Giani Kuldeep Singh Gargajj, also joined the calls, urging the governments of India and Pakistan to reopen the Kartarpur corridor, especially now that the “atmosphere between the two countries is becoming more peaceful”. Sikhs pray daily for open access to the gurdwaras from which they were separated, and therefore, keeping the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor closed is not justified, he said, adding that the corridor would further contribute to peace and harmony between the two nations and strengthen mutual ties. New Delhi allows trucks from Afghanistan carrying perishable items to enter country via Wagah Since its inauguration in 2019 , a large number of Sikh devotees have been visiting the holy site in Narowal, where they bow in reverence and receive the blessings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Hence, reopening the corridor without delay would reflect and honour the sentiments of the Sikh community. According to Jathedar Gargajj, both nations — and the region as a whole — are in greater need of peace, progress, mutual love, and cooperation, rather than tension and conflict. He praised those national and international leaders who played a wise and compassionate role in defusing the war-like situation and promoting calm. A separate report in Indian newspaper The Hindustan Times said the ceasefire between India and Pakistan brought renewed hope to Indian devotees, eager to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, the final resting place of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak. Although Pakistan continued to keep its side of the corridor open, India suspended the pilgrimage on May 7. Approximately 150 Sikh pilgrims, who had arrived at the Dera Baba Nanak Integrated Check Post in India’s Gurdaspur district, were turned back after waiting over 90 minutes, as the corridor was abruptly shut after tensions rose due to the Pahalgam attack . Nevertheless, the Sikh community remains optimistic. Dera Baba Nanak resident Baba Sukhdeep Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak, echoed this sentiment: “The recent hostilities cast a shadow over the future of the corridor. This ceasefire is welcome news for us. We struggled for many years to see this corridor become a reality.” The Kartarpur corridor was jointly inaugurated by the Pakistan and Indian prime ministers on November 9, 2019. It grants Indian pilgrims visa-free, dawn-to-dusk access to the revered shrine. Stretching 4.7 km, it connects Dera Baba Nanak Sahib in India’s Punjab with Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan. Wagah-Attari border While the Kartarpur corridor remains shut, the Indian government has allowed the entry of freight trucks from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan into India through the Wagah-Attari border. Official sources said the Afghan authorities had requested the Indian Ministry of External Affairs to facilitate 162 freight trucks stuck in Pakistan due to the border closure. “In this regard, it is intimated that the Government of India has given necessary permission to allow the aforementioned 162 trucks into India through the Wagah-Attari Border. It is further intimated that Indian Customs have made necessary arrangements to facilitate the movement of cargo in aforesaid 162 trucks,” an official document revealed. Mukesh Sidhwani, a dry fruit trader from Amritsar, welcomed the development. “The trucks have started crossing over. So far, five trucks have crossed. This is a huge relief. The goods are semi-perishable, and every day’s delay translates into massive losses,” the report quoted him as saying. Nearly 90 per cent of India’s trade with Afghanistan is routed through the Attari-Wagah border, which is also the only land link allowed for trade between India and Pakistan. The development came a few days after Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar held his first-ever conversation with Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and underlined India’s friendship with the Afghan people and its support for their development needs.

      "title": "Ex-US president Joe Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer",
      "description": "Former US president Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office said in a statement on Sunday. Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing urinary symptoms, and he and his family are reviewing treatment options with doctors, according to the statement. “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said. Cancers that have spread, or metastasised, are considered Stage 4, the most advanced. Most prostate cancers are detected at an earlier stage. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, of the 236,659 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2021, 70 per cent were diagnosed before the cancer had spread beyond the prostate. About 8pc of new prostate cancer diagnoses that year involved advanced-stage disease. Biden’s physical health and mental acuity drew scrutiny during his 2021-2025 presidency. He abruptly ended his bid for reelection last July, weeks after a halting performance during a debate against Republican Donald Trump prompted panic among his fellow Democrats. President Trump, who has repeatedly berated Biden since taking office in January, expressed sympathy on Sunday for Biden and his wife, Jill, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. “Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” he wrote, referring to first lady Melania Trump. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.” Former US president Barack Obama took to his X to offer sympathies and prayed for a “fast and full recovery” for Biden. Obama hoped Biden “will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.” Biden’s office said the cancer scored a nine out of 10 on the Gleason score grading system, which is used to help determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Dr Herbert Lepor, a urologist at NYU Langone, said a score of nine is “very high risk,” but added that many men can live “five to 10 years and beyond” even with metastatic prostate cancer. “Over the last decade, there have been many advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer,” he said. Dr Chris George, the medical director of the cancer programme for the Northwestern Health Network, said prostate cancer is no longer curable once it spreads to the bones, but that there are treatments that can control it. Biden, Trump oldest to win presidency Biden was the oldest person to win the US presidency at the time of his election in 2020. Trump, 78, broke that record when he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Some prominent Democrats have recently acknowledged that it was an error to advance Biden as the 2024 nominee, given widespread concerns among voters about his age. Long before the debate last summer, Reuters/Ipsos polls showed a majority of Americans, including most Democrats, believed Biden was too old to serve a second term. “It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,” Democratic US Senator Chris Murphy told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning, before Biden’s diagnosis was announced. Biden has kept a low profile since leaving office, making only a handful of public appearances, including an April speech in which he defended the Social Security Administration against Trump’s planned cuts. He has also defended his legacy in interviews and rejected reporting in two new books that he suffered from cognitive decline during his last year in office. “They are wrong,” he said earlier this month on ABC’s “The View,” referring to the books’ authors. Biden’s diagnosis triggered an outpouring of supportive statements on Sunday from Democrats and Republicans alike. “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris said in a statement on X. Biden lost a son, Beau Biden, in 2015 due to brain cancer. In 2022, Biden revived an Obama-era programme known as Cancer Moonshot, seeking to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50pc over the next 25 years.",

      "translatedTitle": "Ex-US president Joe Biden diagnosed with ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer",
      "translatedDescription": "Former US president Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office said in a statement on Sunday. Biden, 82, was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing urinary symptoms, and he and his family are reviewing treatment options with doctors, according to the statement. “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” his office said. Cancers that have spread, or metastasised, are considered Stage 4, the most advanced. Most prostate cancers are detected at an earlier stage. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, of the 236,659 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 2021, 70 per cent were diagnosed before the cancer had spread beyond the prostate. About 8pc of new prostate cancer diagnoses that year involved advanced-stage disease. Biden’s physical health and mental acuity drew scrutiny during his 2021-2025 presidency.

      "description": "• Criticises erosion of democratic rights in India-held Kashmir since 2019 • Advises UK to take balanced stance, raise rights issues, and consult Kashmiri diaspora LONDON: The United Kingdom (UK) Parliament has called for renewed diplomatic engagement between India and Pakis­tan over the Kashmir dispute, highlighting human rights concerns and urging the UK government to adopt a more active, balanced role in addressing the region’s long-standing tensions . In a report published by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Commi­ttee, as part of a wider inquiry into the UK’s strategy for South Asia, lawmakers expressed alarm over the deteriorating situation in India-held Kashmir since August 2019, when the Indian government revoked the region’s special constitutional status under the Article 370. The report cited increased military presence , restrictions on civil liberties , limitations on press freedom and arbitrary detentions , concluding that “there had been a marked erosion of democratic rights in the region.” The committee also examined governance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. While acknowledging the situation in these areas differs from Indian-occupied Kashmir, the report noted ongoing concerns about democratic limitations and the lack of full constitutional representation. It recommended the UK government continue to monitor human rights and political conditions on both sides of the Line of Control. The cross-party committee called on the British government to make greater use of its diplomatic channels and historic ties with both New Delhi and Islamabad to encourage dialogue. While reaffirming the UK’s position that the Kashmir issue “must be resolved bilaterally by India and Pakistan,” the report stressed this “should not prevent Britain from raising concerns, especially over human rights violations.” Parliamentarians urged the Foreign, Common­wealth and Development Office (FCDO) to press both countries to allow greater access for international observers, including British parliamentarians and diplomats, to visit both sides of the disputed territory. They also recommended the UK take a more balanced approach, engaging with both governments equally and avoiding any perception of partisanship, while ensuring its diplomacy is rooted in British values of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. The report further advised that the UK should listen closely to the views of the large Kashmiri diaspora in Britain, encouraging the government to be mindful of community concerns and to use its influence to foster peace and reconciliation. The report, titled “India and Pakistan: a UK foreign policy strategy for the 2020s,” forms part of a broader examination of British foreign policy priorities. It reflects growing parliamentary concern over rising authoritarianism in parts of South Asia and the potential consequences of inaction on long-standing regional conflicts. While acknowledging sensitivities, the committee argued that the UK “cannot remain passive in the face of growing instability in Kashmir.” It concluded that discreet but principled diplomacy, consistent rights monitoring, and a willingness to engage with both sides could play a constructive role. The UK government is expected to respond formally to the committee’s recommendations in the coming months. Kashmir dispute could spark nuclear war Also, the British Par­liament criticised India’s aggressive behaviour, warning that the longstanding Kashmir dispute with Pakistan poses a serious threat to regional stability and could potentially escalate into a nuclear conflict, APP adds. A 42-page report recently made public highlights the clashing approaches of the two South Asian nations, with India favouring bilateral dialogue and Pakistan advocating for international mediation in accordance with United Nations resolutions. The report says that India used a “suspicious incident in occupied Kashmir” as a justification to take military action against Pakistan — a move the report says threatens regional peace. It also criticises India for “creating obstacles in the way of a solution to the Kashmir issue” by disregarding UN mandates. The report further accuses the international community, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, of inaction on the matter. According to the report, Pakistan adopted a defensive strategy “within the framework of responsibility, patience and international law” during the recent conflict. Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",

      "title": "Noor Mukadam case: SC to resume hearing Zahir Jaffer’s appeal against death sentence today",
      "description": "The Supreme Court will resume hearing today an appeal against the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer, the main suspect in the gruesome murder of Noor Mukadam. Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court was upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which had also turned his jail term over rape charges into a second death penalty. Justice Hashim Kakar would lead the three-member bench, which includes Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi. The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case would be taken up as well. An appeal by Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, against the acquittal of Zahir’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also among the pleas being heard. In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court. Case history Noor, 27, was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested at the site of the murder. In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison. Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, had been indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court. Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents. According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence. In March 2023, the IHC, dismissing the Zahir’s appeal , not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction. The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR. The murder After an FIR was registered in the case and Zahir was arrested, his parents and household staff were also taken into custody by police on July 24, 2021 over allegations of “hiding evidence and being complicit in the crime”. They were made a part of the investigation based on the statement of Noor’s father. In his complaint, Shaukat had stated that he had gone to Rawalpindi on July 19 to buy a goat for Eidul Azha, while his wife had gone out to pick up clothes from her tailor. When he had returned home in the evening, the couple found their daughter Noor absent from their house in Islamabad. They had found her cellphone number switched off and started a search for her. Sometime later, Noor had called her parents to inform them that she was travelling to Lahore with some friends and would return in a day or two, according to the FIR. The complainant said he had later received a call from Zahir, whose family were their acquaintances. Zahir had informed Shaukat that Noor was not with him, the FIR said. At around 10pm on July 20, the victim’s father had received a call from Kohsar police station, informing him that Noor had been murdered. Police had subsequently taken the complainant to Zahir’s house in Sector F-7/4 where he discovered that his “daughter has been brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”, according to the FIR. Shaukat, who identified his daughter’s body, had sought the maximum punishment under the law against Zahir for allegedly murdering his daughter. Police later said that Zahir had confessed to killing Noor, while his DNA test and fingerprints also showed his involvement in the murder. More to follow",

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan, China and Afgha­nistan are set to hold tripartite talks in Beijing on Tuesday (tomorrow) to disc­uss regional peace and security in the wake of a military standoff between Pakistan and India. According to media reports, the foreign ministers of the three nations will meet to discuss issues of mutual interest, including regional stability and cooperation. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is set to leave today (Monday) for an official visit to Beijing from May 19 to 22 to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability, the Foreign Office said on Sunday. Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is expected to arrive in Beijing tomorrow. The talks follow the recently brokered ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and amid reports that Afghanistan was supporting India in the conflict with Pakistan. Pakis­tan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said in a statement on Sunday that no country was supporting India except Israel and Afghanistan. Mr Dar’s visit is being seen as significant as tensions remained high in the region following a tense military standoff between Pakistan and India over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. India blamed the attack on Pakistan without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down six Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire . India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Paki­stan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue. China had also reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid the escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5. According to the Foreign Office, Mr Dar will travel to China today at the invitation of the Chinese foreign minister and will hold in-depth discussions there. “The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the Foreign Office said. “The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.” It added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between the two countries. Pakistan and China share longstanding strategic ties, with economic cooperation at the core of their relationship. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, continues to be described by Pakistani officials as a “lifeline” for the national economy. In March, China further extended its financial support by rolling over a $2 billion loan for one year, easing pressure on Pakistan’s foreign exch­ange reserves and offering critical relief amid economic challenges.

      "description": "FOOD insecurity across the world has reached unprecedented levels, with conflict, economic shocks, and climate extremes pushing millions to the edge of starvation, according to the Global Report on Food Crises . The situation is most harrowing in Gaza, where the entire population of 2.1m is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. As of March 2024, more than half the population was classified in IPC Phase 4 Emergency levels, while an alarming 50pc faced Catastrophe conditions (IPC Phase 5), the final stage before famine is officially declared. This is not just a humanitarian failure but a result of deliberate policy and sustained conflict. Gaza’s economy has collapsed under a 17-year blockade and repeated military escalations. By the end of 2024, 75pc of cropland, 57pc of greenhouses, and 68pc of wells had been destroyed. In north Gaza and Gaza governorates, 70pc of the population was surviving under Catastrophe-level conditions, relying almost entirely on inadequate humanitarian aid. Food prices skyrocketed , with wheat flour prices increasing by 3,000pc between February and April 2025. Efforts at mitigation remain woefully insufficient. Humanitarian access has been severely restricted , with aid trucks entering Gaza far below pre-conflict levels, and the risk of famine remains persistent throughout 2025. The global community must push for an immediate ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access. While Gaza’s plight is the most severe, Pakistan too faces a worrying food security outlook. Although food inflation fell to 0.3pc by December 2024, down from double digits earlier in the year, poverty and unemployment continue to hinder access to food. The 2022 floods left lasting scars , and extreme weather events in 2023 and 2024 further eroded livelihoods, particularly in rural Balochistan, Sindh and KP. These regions also face deteriorating water security , further compounding agricultural losses and pushing subsistence farmers into deeper debt traps. As of the latest assessments, 11m people in Pakistan remain in IPC Phase 3 Crisis or worse, with 2.2m in Emergency conditions. High levels of acute malnutrition are particularly alarming in Sindh and KP, with a significant number of children born with low birth weight and a large burden of diarrhoea and respiratory infections exacerbating the crisis. Compounding these challenges is the global reduction in humanitarian funding, which has curtailed food assistance programmes. Immediate policy interventions are needed. The centre and provinces must strengthen social safety nets, ensure nutrition support for mothers and children, and invest in climate-resilient agriculture . Without decisive action, Pakistan risks falling deeper into a chronic cycle of hunger and poverty. In a world where millions go to bed hungry, and where children’s futures are traded for geopolitical gains, we must ask: how long can humanity endure this? Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",

      "description": "IT may be too early to fully assess the multiple dimensions of the India-Pakistan crisis but some conclusions can be drawn. Never before had the two countries attacked each other’s mainland with missile and air strikes as well as deployed new generation technology and weapons including drones. And never before had they edged so close to all-out war after becoming nuclear-wea­pon states. The rapid escalation in the military confrontation went beyond the traditional battleground of occupied Kashmir and much further than previous crises to test deterrence. This was unprecedented but the way the crisis was defu­sed — by third-party intervention — followed a well-rehearsed path and mimicked the past. The military, diplomatic and international dimensions of the crisis need to be carefully examined to make an assessment about the future. Predictably, both countries have drawn very different conclusions from the crisis. The Indian claim, voiced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is that a ‘ new normal ’ against terrorism has been established by India’s military actions, and that in future any terrorist attack will be deemed an act of war and responded to militarily by this ‘new’ doctrine. Pakistan sees its kinetic response in the crisis to have demonstrated that conventional deterrence worked as it prevented India from escalating to an even bigger conflict and thwarted India’s effort to expand space for conventional war under the nuclear overhang. India’s loss of several Rafale aircraft symbolised the costs imposed by Pakistan’s retaliation . That and its ability to strike at multiple targets in the Indian mainland showed its conventional capabilities were able to force a ceasefire and neutralise India’s aims of ‘limited war’. The reality is that India failed to achieve its military objectives in the conflict in spite of Modi’s unsubstantiated assertions of having destroyed “terrorist infrastructure”. It miscalculated the consequences of its actions. Its resort to a military ‘solution’ for a terror attack backfired. The claim that a new norm has been created by India flies in the face of facts. The assertion that henceforth India would respond militarily if there is another terror attack is easier said than done, given the unedifying outcome of the latest crisis for New Delhi. With the credibility of Pakistan’s conventional deterrence re-established if not strengthened, the costs for India could be even higher the next time around for it to consider similar action. India got a new normal but not the one it wanted. An uneasy truce prevails between India and Pakistan with dim prospects of any diplomatic re-engagement. As both countries have drawn sharply conflicting conclusions and lessons from their military confrontation this heightens the risk for miscalculation and creates uncertainty ahead, especially if sustained communication is not established between them. Contact between the DGMOs after the ceasefire has been important but the communication channel has to go beyond a technical or tactical level. There is little immediate possibility of this. This continues to make the situation fraught and unpredictable especially as Modi has declared India has “only suspended” military operations. The diplomatic costs of the crisis were even greater for India than the military costs. By its reckless military actions, New Delhi lost significant international ground as global attention shifted from terrorism to the danger of a full-fledged war with India climbing up the escalatory ladder. This showed how poorly the Modi government assessed the international environment. The clash brought global attention back to Kashmir, to the Modi government’s discomfiture. In the biggest blow to New Delhi, President Donald Trump in announcing the ceasefire offered to mediate on Kashmir. While this will be rejected by India, it catapults Kashmir to the global stage. India also failed to elicit any international support for its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty . Even the US asked India to observe the treaty in private conversations with Indian officials. Moreover, US intervention to defuse the crisis and Trump’s statements after the ceasefire re-hyphenated India and Pakistan, which India has tried so hard over the years to delink. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran acknowledged to the Financial Times that the crisis set back New Delhi’s efforts to dissuade countries from treating India and Pakistan “on a par, and relations with each as interlinked”. “That hyphenation is now back,” he added. If a top Indian geopolitical goal is to join the world’s big league this crisis has produced the opposite outcome for New Delhi. The Modi government also misjudged the evolving American position, assuming it would receive unequivocal support from Washington for its military action to avenge the Pahalgam terror incident. But the Trump administration sought to defuse the crisis from its very onset, urging restraint on New Delhi (and Islamabad) both publicly and privately. As the crisis escalated, US diplomatic intervention intensified. This was reflected in multiple phone calls made by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to top leaders in both countries and finally Vice President J.D. Vance’s intercession with PM Modi when the crisis looked like spinning out of control. This led to the ceasefire President Trump announced and claimed credit for. The Indians neither publicly welcomed his announcement nor acknowledged the US role in ending the crisis. Modi made no mention of this in his post-ceasefire speech. Later, Indian officials refuted the US role. This contrasted sharply with the synchronous communication and close understanding between Pakistan and China throughout the crisis including in vital intelligence cooperation. As for the political ramifications of the crisis, this provided a contrasting picture. The outcome divided India while uniting Pakistan . Modi came under mounting domestic pressure to explain what he achieved by Operation Sindoor . His right-wing base was furious at the truce. With his strongman image dented, the opposition said Modi had much to answer for while the Congress president criticised the government for “strategic missteps”. In Pakistan there was jubilation at the outcome , rallying of national unity and renewal of national confidence while the public standing and reputation of the armed forces went up exponentially. An uneasy truce now prevails between India and Pakistan with a fragile ceasefire that is being implemented in phases. Confidence-building measures are being taken to reduce military tensions and the “level of alertness”. But it will be a mistake to conclude that ‘normalcy’ will return anytime soon. The outlook remains troubled and fraught with uncertainty. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN. Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",

      "description": "Indian police have arrested multiple people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi —including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation between the two countries, Indian media reported on Sunday. The development follows a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets . After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached. Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed as “ Operation Sindoor ”. The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to Scroll . Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs. In a social media post on May 8, Mahmudabad, the head of the university’s political science department, had highlighted the apparent irony of right-wing Hindutva commentators praising Colonel Sofia Qureshi, who had addressed the media briefings. He wrote: “Perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynching, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the BJP’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens. “The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is importantly [sic] but optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy,” Mahmudabad noted. “The grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united in its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea,” he further said. The Haryana State Commission interpreted his remarks as “an attempt to vilify national military actions”, the Hindustan Times reported. The Haryana State Commission for Women had taken suo motu cognisance of his remarks on Col Qureshi, saying they undermined women officers in the Indian armed forces and fomented communal discord. ThePrint , in an editorial, said: “The vicious hounding and egregious arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad for expressing his opinion is a shameful insult to our millennia-old democratic tradition. “His argument about war and domestic politics is a constitutional freedom. As is your right to disagree. Calling it an insult to women or military is senseless.” Separately, Indian police have arrested travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra along with five others from Punjab and Haryana over alleged espionage for Pakistan, according to Indian media. Malhotra, a 33-year-old from Haryana’s Hisar district who runs the YouTube channel ‘ Travel With Jo ’, was detained under India’s Official Secrets Act 1923 for allegedly “transmitting sensitive information to Pakistani operatives”, according to India News Network ( INN ). According to the FIR, she came into contact with the alleged Pakistani operative two years ago and visited Pakistan twice, The Hindu reported . Dawn.com has reached out to the Foreign Office for a comment on the claims. Malhotra had uploaded videos on her YouTube channel of her visits to renowned Sikh sites Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Pakistan’s Punjab, with the latest published in March 2025. According to the Minority Rights Group , Sikhs have a “significant” presence in Haryana and form a majority in Punjab. The vlogger’s father, who retired from the Haryana electricity department, denied the allegations and said her daughter was being implicated, The Hindu added. Those arrested with Malhotra included a security guard, a university student and civilians alleged to have “received money or instructions from Pakistani contacts”, according to INN . Among the suspects are Guzala from Malerkotla in Punjab and her “friend” Banu Nasreena, who were granted Pakistani visas in April 2025, the report claimed. Also named in the case is Arman from Haryana’s Nuh district, who allegedly provided Indian SIM cards and transferred money on behalf of the operatives. In another crackdown, Assam Police, acting on army intelligence, arrested seven people and busted a racket allegedly using fake SIM cards to share sensitive information with “Pakistani agents”, Times of India reported . Other than those seven, 14 were under interrogation. Times of India quoted Assam police chief Harmeet Singh as saying that police teams were dispatched to Telangana’s Hyderabad as well as cities in Rajasthan and Assam. Saddik, Arif Khan, and Sajid were arrested in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur and Alwar, while Akeek was taken into custody at the airport in Assam’s Guwahati, Singh said. Arsad was arrested at the New Delhi airport, Mofijul in Telangana, Jakariya in Assam’s Bilasipara town, Time of India reported. Pakistani journalists take reports with a grain of salt On the other side of the border, Pakistani journalists and commentators have cast doubts on the reports by Indian media, which aired multiple fake news stories during the recent tensions between the two countries. A New York Times article yesterday also highlighted how Indian media “amplified falsehoods”, noting that “anchors and commentators became cheerleaders for war”. Journalist Hamid Mir, while responding to an Indian user who shared videos of her blog and accused her of being a spy, wrote on his X account that Malhotra “was not spying and only making a video for her YouTube channel”. “Spies don’t make videos for public use […] they make secret videos for secret use. Pakistan doesn’t need these kind of spies.” Another Pakistani journalist, Ammara Ahmed, wrote : “Jyoti Malhotra deserves a good lawyer and a fair trial.” Journalist Ailia Zehra, who covers politics and human rights, described the entire episode as “ridiculous”. “What state secrets could a YouTuber possibly have? Ridiculous,” she wrote. Podcaster Shehzad Ghias Shaikh noted: “The message is quite clear, no Indian content creator is to have any interaction with Pakistan or they will be penalised. “Welcome to fascism.”",

      "translatedTitle": "Several held in India over alleged links to Pakistan, remarks on military officers",
      "translatedDescription": "Indian police have arrested multiple people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi —including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation between the two countries, Indian media reported on Sunday. The development follows a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets . After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached. Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed as “ Operation Sindoor ”. The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to Scroll . Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs.
