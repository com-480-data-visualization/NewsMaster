      "description": "If we want to solve injustices in Africa today, we cannot forget the injustices that shaped our shared history John Dramani Mahama is the president of the Republic of Ghana The meeting at the White House between Donald Trump and the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa , was, at its heart, about the preservation of essential historical truths. The US president’s claims of white genocide conflict with the actual racial persecution and massacres that took place during the two centuries of colonisation and nearly 50 years of apartheid in South Africa. It is not enough to be affronted by these claims, or to casually dismiss them as untruths. These statements are a clear example of how language can be leveraged to extend the effects of previous injustices. This mode of violence has long been used against Indigenous Africans. And it cannot simply be met with silence – not any more. John Dramani Mahama is president of the Republic of Ghana Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Since then, her acclaimed graphic novels have focused mainly on herself and her family. Fun Home in 2006 (exploring her closeted, funeral-director father’s suicide and her coming out) was followed by Are You My Mother? (psychoanalysis and her relationship with her mother) and The Secret to Superhuman Strength (her compulsive exercising, from karate and crunches to snowshoeing). These three erudite, pensive and observant works spend most of their time looking back. Where the modern Bechdel is present, she is mostly sketching, editing and narrating her past, and contemplating how everyone from Jack Kerouac and Virginia Woolf to paediatrician Donald Winnicott can help her shed light on it.

Who would choose to listen to endless Jordan Peterson podcasts or watch interminable Andrew Tate videos? Well, the answer is quite a lot of men, even though Bloodworth doesn’t really seem to know why.

A further 6,000 premature deaths will occur in coming years without action, the researchers said. The Dieselgate scandal erupted in 2015 when diesel cars were found to be emitting far more toxic air pollution on the roads than when they passed regulatory tests, due to the use of illegal “defeat devices”.

Instead, it goes to town on a sleazy peephole sexuality that now looks either quaint or distinctly stone-age, depending on your tolerance for aesthetic standards in anime’s red-light district. A miniskirted heroine kitted out like a cos playing bierkeller wench, Medusa-like succubi draining a bounty-hunter of his essence, one character fishing out one of the protagonist’s breasts mid-conversation a propos of nothing … #MeToo feels a very long way off. Seriously underdressed to fight mutants in an apocalyptic wasteland, Doris Lang (voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa) is waylaid by Count Magnus Lee (Seizō Katō), who is intent on making her his bride. So she hires roving mercenary D – half-undead, half-human, Blade-style “dhampir” – to dispatch this horror. Not only does he have to hack down a thicket of minions en route, including shock-haired mutant Rei (Kazuyuki Sogabe) and Lee’s snooty daughter L’Armica (Satoko Kitou), he has his own baser nature to deal with. Arguing with a symbiote who inhabits his left palm when the bloodlust kicks in, he is a paid-up member of the self-hating undead brethren. Continue reading...",

Losing them can mean more than just downtime from work. Here’s what to do in the event the worst happens. Try to locate it using Microsoft or Apple’s Find My device service, lock it remotely and mark it as lost to help secure your data. Remove it as a trusted device for services you use, including your Apple or Microsoft account, cloud accounts, shops or other browser-based apps. Change your passwords for key accounts, including your Apple or Microsoft account. Start with your email to prevent thieves using it to gain access to your other accounts through password resets. Report the theft to the police by calling 101 in the UK and give them a description of the laptop, make, model, colour and serial number, which may be on the box or in your Apple or Microsoft account. Contact your insurance provider if you have cover, your laptop may come under some home contents policies. Tell your bank about any credit cards you may have details of stored on your laptop. Contact the laptop’s manufacturer to report the theft so it can blacklist its serial number, which may prevent it being activated and used by someone else. Set a strong password or long pin that cannot be easily guessed, set up and use any face or fingerprint scanners and make sure the screen is set to lock after a short period, usually when the screen turns off. Turn on device encryption in your privacy and security settings if not already enabled. Set up two-step verification for your Microsoft or Apple account, as well as any others you use. Turn on “Find My” in a Windows 10 or 11’s security settings or in iCloud settings on a Mac , which will help you locate a lost laptop, remotely lock it and mark it as lost with a message on its screen for anyone who finds it. Back up your data regularly. On a Windows laptop you can use Windows Backup to store files and settings on Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud service (5GB free). On a Mac you can use Time Machine to back up the laptop to an external drive or sync your apps and files with iCloud (you can store 5GB for free). Alternatively, copy files to an external drive but be sure to encrypt it first before backing up any sensitive documents. Host important documents in the cloud. Microsoft and Apple have cloud services, but there are many others including Google Drive, Dropbox and Proton Drive. Take note of your laptop’s colour, model number and serial number, and store your proof of purchase somewhere safe. Consider putting the laptop on your home contents insurance, which may need it to be added to the high-risk or high-value items list, particularly if you take it out of the home.

It’s the sort of cooking that feels generous but effortless; everything simmers away in one big pan, and produces a sauce that’s rich and thick from the potato starch but lemony and fresh-tasting, too. I also often find myself craving an entire cucumber for lunch, so I love today’s salad for its simplicity and for its big flavours. I really enjoy writing recipes that I believe people will come back to again and again, and I think this is definitely one of those. Continue reading...",

      "description": "¿Tiene sentido que una empresa mantenga una gran cantidad de efectivo en su balance? En teoría no, es mejor devolver el dinero a los accionistas y dejar que decidan qué hacer con él. En realidad, compañías como Apple y Berkshire Hathaway se han convertido en enormes alcancías, y los inversionistas parecen estar de acuerdo con eso.Algunas empresas aprovechan esta anomalía y al hacerlo con alegría y entusiasmo, mantienen bitcoines en lugar de dólares. El negocio familiar presidencial Trump Media & Technology Group ya recaudó 2 mil 500 millones de dólares para este fin. Se une a la plataforma de streaming libertaria Rumble, a la favorita de las acciones meme GameStop y a Tesla. El mayor exponente de las tesorerías de criptomonedas es Strategy, antes conocida como MicroStrategy, que posee 64 mil millones de dólares en bitcoines.Hay tres posibles razones que una compañía puede dar para mantener un activo digital como bitcóin. Una es obtener ganancias si su precio sube. Eso, además de ser inescrutable, se descarta con facilidad. Los inversionistas pueden invertir en el token ellos mismos, directo o a través de un ETF.Una mejor razón puede ser que la empresa cree que puede hacer algo con bitcóin que los inversionistas no pueden.En el caso de Strategy, ese algo es una astuta ingeniería financiera que implica la emisión de bonos convertibles y acciones preferentes en condiciones favorables, recaudando dinero para comprar más tokens.Strive, un gestor de activos de tendencia conservadora a punto de salir a bolsa mediante una fusión con una compañía que cotiza en bolsa llamada Asset Entities, espera añadir su propio toque a ese modelo de negocio, comprando empresas con grandes cantidades de efectivo infravaloradas y convirtiéndolas en bitcóin. El martes anunció que planea recaudar hasta mil 500 millones de dólares y que los invertirá en estrategias de “generación de alfa” o de superación del mercado.En algunos casos, las empresas afirman que el bitcóin es un complemento lógico para sus otros negocios. Los inversionistas deben creer en las utilidades de estas oportunidades imprecisas cuando las ven. Rumble quiere ofrecer monederos de criptomonedas. Trump Media afirma que generará “sinergias para pagos de suscripciones, un tóken de utilidad (o de usuario) y otras transacciones que tienen planeadas”.El tercer argumento es que el bitcóin es el futuro, por lo que no mantenerlo sería una tontería. El director ejecutivo de Strive, Matt Cole, argumenta altaneramente que el bitcóin debe ser la base para medir otros activos e inversiones, y que Strive es su Berkshire Hathaway. Trump Media lo considera como “un instrumento cumbre de libertad financiera” que lo liberará del acoso de las instituciones tradicionales.Para alguien que cree en la supremacía del bitcóin, todo esto tiene mucho sentido. Las empresas que se apalanquen para comprar tókenes digitales obtendrán mayores rendimientos, navegando con alegría hacia el punto en que el activo reemplace al dólar como la lengua franca financiera global. La rentabilidad sobre el capital (ROE) es, en este mundo, algo anticuado; bitcoin por acción es la métrica a perseguir.La mayoría de los accionistas de empresas que cotizan en bolsa seguirán con cierta preferencia por los activos reales con rendimientos en efectivo predecibles. Deberían ver la tendencia de la tesorería del bitcóin como lo que es: una apuesta arriesgada y un intento de aprovechar el éxito de Strategy, que cotiza a aproximadamente 1.6 veces el valor de sus tenencias de criptomonedas. Por otra parte, la belleza de los mercados reside en que cada olla tiene su límite.",

      "translatedTitle": "Bitcóin model, a risky bet for investors",
      "translatedDescription": "Does it make sense that a company maintains a large amount of cash in your balance? In theory no, it is better to return the money to the shareholders and let them decide what to do with him. Actually, companies such as Apple and Berkshire Hathaway have become huge fish, and investors seem to agree with that. Some companies take advantage of this anomaly and in doing so with joy and enthusiasm, they maintain bitcoines instead of dollars. The Trump Media & Technology Group presidential business already raised 2,500 million dollars for this purpose. It joins the Rumble libertarian streaming platform, at the favorite of the Meme Gamestop and Tesla actions. The largest exponent of cryptocurrency treasures is Strategy, formerly known as Microstrategy, which has 64 billion dollars in bitcoines. There are three possible reasons that a company can give to maintain a digital asset as a bitcóin. One is earnings if its price goes up. That, in addition to being inscrutable, is easily ruled out. Investors can invest in the token themselves, direct or through an ETF. A better reason may be that the company believes that it can do something with bitcóin that investors cannot. Conservative trend about to go over by means of a fusion with a company that quotes on the stock market called Asset Entities, hopes to add its own touch to that business model, buying companies with large amounts of infraval cash and turning them into bitcóin. On Tuesday, he announced that he plans to raise up to 1,500 million dollars and that he will invest in “alpha generation” or market overcoming strategies. In some cases, companies claim that bitcóin is a logical complement to their other businesses. Investors must believe in the profits of these imprecise opportunities when they see them. Rumble wants to offer cryptocurrency purses. Trump Media states that he will generate “synergies for subscription payments, a utility (or user) tóken and other transactions they have planned.” The third argument is that bitcóin is the future, so not maintaining it would be nonsense. Strive executive director, Matt Cole, discharges that the bitcóin should be the basis for measuring other assets and investments, and that Strive is his Berkshire Hathaway. Trump Media considers it as \"a summit instrument of financial freedom\" that will release him from the harassment of traditional institutions. For someone who believes in the supremacy of Bitcóin, all this makes a lot of sense. Companies that are pounced to buy digital tókenes will obtain greater yields, sailing with joy towards the point where the asset replaces the dollar as the global financial language. Profitability on capital (ROE) is, in this world, something outdated; Bitcoin per action is the metric to pursue. The majority of the shareholders of companies that are traded in the stock market will continue with some preference for real assets with predictable cash yields. They should see the tendency of the Bitcóin treasury as what it is: a risky bet and an attempt to take advantage of Strategy's success, which quotes approximately 1.6 times the value of its cryptocurrency holdings. On the other hand, the beauty of the markets lies in the fact that each pot has its limit.",

      "title": "Liga Mexicana de Beisbol sigue creciendo junto a sus patrocinadores",
      "description": "Es claro que el beisbol nacional ha tomado un nuevo auge con la Liga Mexicana de Beisbol transmitiendo sus juegos cada vez en más pantallas y llevando más gente a los estadios en cada calendario. El crecimiento es palpable y las grandes marcas lo saben, especialmente cuando la LMB ha alcanzado una docena de patrocinadores a nivel nacional durante los últimos cinco años con los que seguirá apuntalando su digitalización. Horacio de la Vega, presidente ejecutivo de la Liga Mexicana de Beisbol, aseguró en entrevista exclusiva para Séptima Entrada que los ingresos de la Liga han crecido gracias al aumento de las alianzas estratégicas que, a nivel nacional, tienen al menos 13 marcas, patrocinios que a cambio reciben un retorno de inversión en tres grandes vertientes: transmisiones, hospitality y contenidos digitales. “Ya tenemos un número interesante de patrocinadores”, dijo De la Vega. “Hemos ido creciendo paulatinamente en los últimos tres o cuatro años el número de marcas que se han asociado al beisbol de nuestro país”.Cobertura nacional en tv La creación y homologación de un producto televisivo ha sido catalizador en todos los aspectos. La LMB cuenta con 35 contratos de televisoras, con 15 de ellos siendo canales de televisión abierta y de paga con cobertura a nivel nacional e internacional, teniendo un impacto de 55 millones de personas alrededor del mundo con casi 2 mil 640 horas de producción durante el año pasado, según datos proporcionados por la LMB. Las audiencias han crecido de 5.6 millones de personas registradas en 2019 hasta las 59.1 millones que vieron la liga en 2024, marcando un crecimiento del 800 por ciento en el alcance de audiencias de TV y plataformas digitales, sin contar las 4 millones de personas más que presenciaron la Serie del Rey entre Sultanes de Monterrey y Diablos Rojos del México, el evento más visto del año en la LMB. Aprovechando el ambiente familiar y la experiencia que se vive en los 21 estadios que conforman el circuito, la liga ha aprovechado para ofrecer a sus aliados comerciales algunos beneficios más allá de los convencionales, especialmente los espacios dentro de los parques de pelota. “A veces el impacto de una marca en el retorno de inversión es difícil de medir”, señaló Horacio. “Que se capitalice la parte económica, pero que, por otro lado, tenga este otro componente como el Hospitality. Tenemos boletos y palcos que nos permiten ofrecer otras experiencias que nuestros patrocinadores pueden trasladar hacia sus propios clientes, y con eso también capitalizan una relación de negocios”. Proponiendo una relación de ganar-ganar entre ambas partes, la LMB ha sumado año con año más aliados comerciales a la que podría ser la Liga con más crecimiento durante los últimos años en el deporte profesional mexicano.Incremento en la asistencia La asistencia en los estadios ha aumentado exponencialmente, aun regresando de la pandemia que en 2021 solo permitió la entrada a 2.4 millones de personas a los estadios de la liga. En 2024 la cifra se duplicó a 4.8 millones de personas que cruzaron las entradas de los parques y se espera que esta temporada convoque a 5.2 millones de personas, superando los 3 millones 296 mil 797 de la Liga Mx (solo fase regular) en el Clausura 2025. El lanzamiento de la aplicación para teléfonos móviles le ha permitido a la Liga Mexicana de Beisbol crear una base de datos para conocer mejor a su audiencia, lo que también le permite segmentar mucho mejor las pautas que muestra a ciertos nichos. La aplicación solo es el primer paso en la evolución digital de la LMB que ahora busca cambiar los espacios publicitarios por bardas y elementos en los que puedan superponer las marcas con las que tienen convenio dependiendo de la ciudad, estado o país en la que se está transmitiendo un partido. Es ahí donde los patrocinios podrían tener un nuevo alcance a nivel internacional con acuerdos en países como República Dominicana, Panamá, Venezuela, entre otros. “Tenemos un número importante de jugadores de esos países y lo que podemos empezar a hacer es justamente superponer y empezar a vender (comercialmente) esos juegos que están pasando en Panamá o en Dominicana”, señaló Horacio. “Tener marcas locales o nacionales de ese país y eso puede ser un fenómeno interesante de crecimiento de los activos comerciales y la venta de patrocinios”.

      "translatedTitle": "Mexican Baseball League continues to grow with its sponsors",
      "translatedDescription": "It is clear that national baseball has taken a new boom with the Mexican Baseball League transmitting its games increasingly on more screens and taking more people to the stadiums in each calendar. The growth is palpable and the big brands know it, especially when the LMB has reached a dozen sponsors nationwide during the last five years with which it will continue to underpin their digitalization. Horacio de la Vega, executive president of the Mexican Baseball League, said in an exclusive interview for seventh entry that the revenues of the League have grown thanks to the increase in strategic alliances that, at the national level, have at least 13 brands, sponsorships that in return receive a return on investment in three large aspects: transmissions, hospitality and digital content. \"We already have an interesting number of sponsors,\" said De la Vega. “We have been growing gradually in the last three or four years the number of brands that have been associated with the baseball of our country.” The LMB has 35 television contracts, with 15 of them being open and paying television channels with national and international coverage, having an impact of 55 million people around the world with almost 2,640 hours of production during the past year, according to data provided by the LMB. The audiences have grown from 5.6 million people registered in 2019 to 59.1 million who saw the league in 2024, marking a growth of 800 percent in the reach of TV audiences and digital platforms, not counting the 4 million more people who witnessed the King's series between Monterrey Sultans and Red Devils of Mexico, the most watched event of the year in the LMB. Taking advantage of the family environment and the experience that is lived in the 21 stadiums that make up the circuit, the League has taken the opportunity to offer its commercial allies some benefits beyond the conventional ones, especially the spaces within the ball parks. \"Sometimes the impact of a brand on investment return is difficult to measure,\" said Horacio. \"That the economic part is capitalized, but that, on the other hand, has this other component such as hospitality. We have tickets and boxes that allow us to offer other experiences that our sponsors can move to their own customers, and with that they also capitalize on a business relationship.\" Proposing a win-win relationship between both parties, the LMB has added year after year more commercial allies to which the league could be with more growth in recent years in Mexican professional sport. Invice in assistance assistance in the stadiums has increased exponentially, even returning from the pandemic that in 2021 only allowed the entry to 2.4 million people to the stages of the League. In 2024 the figure doubled to 4.8 million people who crossed the parks' tickets and is expected that this season summon 5.2 million people, exceeding 3 million 296 thousand 797 of the MX League (only regular phase) in the closure 2025. The launch of the application for mobile phones has allowed the Mexican Baseball League to create a database to know its audience better to know its audience, to know its database, to know a datab which also allows you to segment much better the guidelines that show certain niches. The application is only the first step in the digital evolution of the LMB that now seeks to change the advertising spaces for fences and elements in which the brands with which they have agreement depending on the city, state or country in which a party is being transmitted are superimposed. It is there where sponsorships could have a new international range with agreements in countries such as the Dominican Republic, Panama, Venezuela, among others. \"We have an important number of players from those countries and what we can start doing is just overlap and start selling (commercially) those games that are happening in Panama or Dominican,\" said Horacio. \"To have local or national brands of that country and that can be an interesting phenomenon for the growth of commercial assets and the sale of sponsorships.\"   MGC",

      "title": "Últimos días para recibir utilidades, ¿Qué hacer si no te las pagan?",
      "description": "Si estás seguro que la empresa en donde laboras o tu empleador están obligados a darte utilidades, pero no recibiste este derecho. Esto es lo que debes hacer, según expertos.Primero, hay que señalar que el reparto de utilidades es un derecho que está establecido por ley en el artículo 123 de la Constitución Mexicana y, este año, las empresas tienen hasta el 30 de mayo para pagarlas, mientras que si el empleador es una persona física el límite es hasta el 29 de junio.Ahora bien, de acuerdo con la Ley Federal de Trabajo son obligadas al reparto de utilidades todas las unidades económicas de producción o distribución de bienes o servicios y toda persona física o moral que tengan personas trabajadoras a su cargo, sean o no contribuyentes del impuesto sobre la renta.Esto siempre y cuando no sean empresas de nueva creación (hayan pasado el primer año de funcionamiento), que generan productos nuevos, que tienen un plazo de dos años de excepción, las empresas de industria extractiva durante el periodo de exploración, instituciones de asistencia privada como el Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) o que ganen menos de 300 mil pesos de utilidad en el año.Especialistas en materia laboral en México detallaron a MILENIO que es importante que aún cuando es difícil que una empresa evada esta responsabilidad, ya que es información pública que se entrega a la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, los trabajadores estén enterados si su empleador está obligado a pagar utilidades, ya que aparte de que es un derecho, es una de las prácticas que logra justicia y un mejor entorno laboral.“Es un derecho que es irrenunciable, es importante que se hagan valer los derechos y no entrar a un tema de prescripción, si no se reclama pudiera existir la posibilidad que este derecho se pierda”, explicó David Eugenio Puente Tostado, especialista en materia laboral del despacho de abogados Basham. “Es importante que se denuncie porque es proteger sus derechos y los de sus compañeros para evitar que las empresas tengan una mala práctica y se garantiza un reparto de utilidades justo y que sea conforme a la ley, y ayuda a hacer una cultura laboral más equitativa y responsable”, explicó Estrella Vázquez, directora de La empresa de consultoría en RH, Time To Grow.Pero también llaman a que los trabajadores no se generen falsas expectativas en cuanto a la cantidad de utilidades que recibirán este año, ya que esto depende de cuestiones económicas del país, el sector en el que laboren, el sueldo más alto de la empresa, etc.“Nadie está obligado a lo imposible, es decir, si el patrón no generó utilidades no está obligado a repartir (...) en ocasiones los trabajadores por desinformación generan falsas expectativas y se limitan a pensar que porque a un compañero, amigo o pariente le dieron cierta cantidad, al trabajador que está en otra industria, otra región, será lo mismo”, detalló el abogado laboral Jorge Sales Boyoli. ¿Cómo saber si mi empresa me tiene que dar utilidades?Para saber si la empresa donde laboras cumple con todos estos requisitos, de acuerdo con lo establecido por ley, los empleadores deben de entregar a los representantes de los trabajadores una copia de la declaración fiscal anual, que se entregó antes del 31 de marzo a las autoridades tributarias, la cual debe de ser entregada a lostrabajadores dentro de los diez días siguientes a los que la empresa la presentó.Además, se establece que en caso de que tus representantes no te hayan informado de cuál fue la utilidad de la empresa, cualquier trabajador puede pedir dicha información a los sindicatos o a las áreas de Recursos Humanos.¿Cómo saber si soy uno de los trabajadores que por ley tiene que recibir utilidades?Una cosa es que la empresa esté obligada a dar utilidades y otra que todos los empleados deban recibirlas, ante esto Marco Antonio Orellana, Head of Legal de Lemontech, puntualizó que lo primero que debe de hacer un trabajador es comprobar que laboró al menos 60 días en el ejercicio fiscal 2024 ya sea de forma continua o discontinua, y que no ocupa un puesto de dirección o administración general.Orellana agregó que los trabajadores tienen derecho a conocer el monto de las utilidades generadas y cómo se determinó su parte proporcional. Además de que la LFT establecen que las empresas deben formar una Comisión Mixta de PTU, con representantes de los trabajadores, para revisar y validar el cálculo y tener listas de los trabajadores.¿Qué puedo hacer si mi empresa no me quiere dar utilidades?Para los trabajadores que ya tengan la seguridad de que la empresa donde laboran tenían que dar utilidadesy no fue así, lo que debe de hacer según los expertos es exigir al empleador una explicación por escrito sobre las razones por las que no se pagó la PTU. Orellana explicó que la empresa debe justificar si no generó utilidades o si aplica alguna exención. Si esto no sucede, los trabajadores pueden acudir a la Procuraduría Federal de la Defensa del Trabajo (PROFEDET) para recibir asesoría gratuita y presentar una denuncia. Esto a través de los teléfonos 018009117877 o 018007172942, así como en el correo electrónico orientacionprofedet@stps.gob.mxAunque los especialistas llaman a un diálogo entre ambas partes, si la empresa se niega a pagar, el trabajador puede presentar una demanda ante la Junta de Conciliación y Arbitraje o los tribunales laborales, dependiendo del caso. El plazo para reclamar es de un año a partir del 31 de mayo de 2025. Orellana también aconseja a lostrabajadores a mantener un registro de las comunicaciones con la empresa y cualquier evidencia de las utilidades generadas.“La queja es particularmente en la dirección de inspecciones de trabajo donde forzosamente en una denuncia de no pago, la Secretaria del Trabajo debe de realizar una inspección externa al centro de trabajo para determinar efectivamente si existió este incumplimiento, también pueden presentar una demanda ante los tribunales; sin embargo, eso llevaría mucho más tiempo”, condenó David Eugenio Puente Tostado, especialista laboral de Basham.Quien agregó que el no pago de utilidades puede ser causal de una huelga colectiva conforme al artículo 450 de la LFT. ¿Qué hacer si tu empleador hizo alguna represalia contra ti por pedir tus utilidades?Como se ha mencionado anteriormente, el reparto de utilidades es un derecho para los trabajadores establecido en la Constitución, pero los especialistas detallan que si bien no es común, se han reportado casos de empleadores que toman represalias en contra de sus trabajadores por exigir este derecho como despidos injustificados, reducción de salario, cambios en las condiciones laborales o cualquier forma de discriminación.Todos concuerdan en que si un trabajador enfrenta represalias, lo que debe de hacer es: Denunciar ante la STPS o PROFEDET: Ya que pueden ofrecer asesoría gratuita e iniciar una investigación contra la empresa.Presentar una demanda por despido injustificado: Si el trabajador es despedido por exigir PTU, puede demandar una indemnización equivalente a tres meses de salario, más 20 días de salario por cada año trabajado, además de los salarios caídos desde el despido hasta la resolución del caso. Además, aconsejan a los trabajadores documentar las represalias:“Es crucial recopilar pruebas, como correos electrónicos, notificaciones o testigos, para respaldar la denuncia”, explicó Orellana. Así como buscar apoyo legal en un abogado especializado en derecho laboral que pueda ayudar a presentar el caso ante las autoridades competentes.El especialista de Basham, explicó que, antes de la denuncia el trabajador, tendrá que agotar una etapa conciliatoria obligatoria, que es ante un centro de conciliación ya sea federal o local. Pero a pesar de eso el consejo que detallan es que sí se debe de denunciar cualquier represalia.¿Qué sanciones o multas puede recibir una empresa que se niega a repartir utilidades?Por ley, las empresas que incumplancon la obligación de pagar la PTUpueden enfrentar ciertas multaso penalizaciones tales como:Multas: Las sanciones pueden oscilar entre 250 y 5,000 veces el valor de la Unidad de Medida y Actualización (UMA), lo que en 2025 equivale aproximadamente a 28 mil 285 a 565 mil 700 pesos mexicanos por cada trabajador afectado. Estas multas pueden multiplicarse si varios empleados presentan quejas.David Puente Tostado agregó que las multas del grado más alto son aquellas cuando existe una intencionalidad de violar la ley, mientras que si se determina que fue un tema de descuido son las de más bajo. ”La propia ley señala que cuando la afectación es a más de un trabajador la secretaria tiene la facultad de multar por cada uno de ellos, entonces estas se pueden multiplicar”, apuntó.Además, lostrabajadores pueden exigir el pago retroactivo de la PTU, más intereses por el retraso.Orellana explicó que a partir del 31 de mayo, la Secretaría de Trabajo y Previsión Social (STPS) iniciará inspecciones para verificar el cumplimiento y aquellas que ya han sido señaladas de incumplimiento pueden enfrentar verificaciones adicionales.AG",

This is what you should do, according to experts. First, it should be noted that the distribution of profits is a right that is established by law in article 123 of the Mexican Constitution and, this year, companies have until May 30 to pay them, while if the employer is a natural person the limit is until June 29. Services and any natural or moral person who have working people in charge, whether or not they are taxpayers of the Income Tax. This as long as they are not newly created companies (the first year of operation have passed), who generate new products, which have a period of two years of exception, the extractive industry companies during the exploration period, private assistance institutions such as the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) or that they win less than 300 thousand pesos of utility in the Year. Specialists in labor matters in Mexico detailed millennium that it is important that even when it is difficult for a company to evade this responsibility, since it is public information that is delivered to the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, workers are aware if their employer is obliged to pay profits, since apart from that it is a right, it is one of the practices that achieve justice and a better work environment. “It is a right that is irrevocable. Do not enter a prescription issue, if it is not claimed, there could be the possibility that this right is lost, ”explained David Eugenio Puente Toast, a workplace specialist of the Basham law firm. \"It is important that it be denounced because it is to protect their rights and those of their colleagues to prevent companies from having a bad practice and a distribution of fair profits is guaranteed and that it is in accordance with the law, and helps to make a more equitable and responsible work culture,\" said Estrella Vázquez, director of the Consulting Company in RH, Time to Grow. They will receive this year, since this depends on economic issues in the country, the sector in which they work, the highest salary of the company, etc. “No one is obliged to the impossible, that is, if the employer did not generate profits, it is not obliged to distribute (...) Sometimes workers by misinformation generate false expectations and are limited to thinking that because a partner, friend or relative gave him a certain amount, to the worker, the worker who is in another industry Region will be the same, ”said labor lawyer Jorge Sales Boyoli. How to know if my company has to give me profits? To know if the company where work meets all these requirements, in accordance with the provisions of law, employers must deliver to the workers' representatives a copy of the annual fiscal declaration, which was delivered before March 31 to the tax authorities, which must be delivered to workmen within the ten days of which the company presented it. You have not informed you what the company's usefulness was, any worker can ask for said information from the unions or to the human resources areas. How to know if I am one of the workers who by law have to receive profits? One thing is that the company is obliged to give utilities and another that all employees must receive them, before this Marco Antonio Orellana, Head of Lemontech, pointed out that the first thing to do is to do that the first thing that the first thing should He worked at least 60 days in fiscal year 2024 either continuously or discontinuously, and that he does not occupy a general management or administration .orellana. In addition to the fact that the LFT establish that companies must form a mixed PTU commission, with workers 'representatives, to review and validate the calculation and have workers' lists. What can I do if my company does not want to give me utilities? For workers who already have the assurance that the company where they work had to give utilities and was not like that, what should be done according to experts is to demand the employer a written explanation of the employer. paid the PTU. Orellana explained that the company must justify whether it did not generate profits or if any exemption applies.

This through the phones 018009117877 or 018007172942, as well as in the email orientacionprofedet@stps.gob.mxAUNQUE The specialists call a dialogue between both parties, if the company refuses to pay, the worker can file a lawsuit before the Conciliation and Arbitration Board or the Labor Courts, depending on the case. The deadline to claim is one year as of May 31, 2025. Orellana also advises the workmen to maintain a registration of communications with the company and any evidence of the utilities generated. “The complaint is particularly in the Directorate of Labor Inspections where in a complaint of non -payment, the secretary of the labor must carry out an external inspection to the work center to effectively determine if there is also a breach, they can also present this breach, they can also exist. demand before the courts; What to do if your employer did any retaliation against you for asking for your profits? As mentioned above, the distribution of profits is a right for the workers established in the Constitution, but the specialists detail that although it is not common, cases of employers who retaliate against their workers have been reported for demanding this right as unjustified dismissals, salary reduction, changes in working conditions or any form of discrimination. They agree that if a worker faces reprisals, what he must do is: denounce before the STPS or PROFEDET: since they can offer free advice and initiate an investigation against the company. Present a law case. In addition, they advise workers to document reprisals: \"It is crucial to collect evidence, such as emails, notifications or witnesses, to support the complaint,\" Orellana explained.

Basham's specialist, explained that, before the complaint the worker, he will have to exhaust a mandatory conciliatory stage, which is before a conciliation center either federal or local.

What in 2025 is equivalent to approximately 28 thousand 285 to 565 thousand 700 Mexican pesos for each affected worker. These fines can multiply if several employees present complaints. \"The law itself states that when the affectation is more than one worker, the secretary has the power to fine for each of them, so these can be multiplied,\" said the workmen, can require retroactive payment of the PTU, more interests for the delay.orellana explained that as of May 31, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (STPS) will begin inspections to verify compliance and those that have already been indicated of non -compliance can face additional verifications.",

Por ejemplo, para aquellos turistas interesados en visitar las ruinas arqueológicas, la decisión tendría capacidad para organizar su ruta incorporando los elementos que más se adapten a sus intereses de la forma más óptima, según el período de su estancia.Pero no solo eso, sino también ofreciendo un turismo más inclusivo para distintas tipologías de viajeros, así como para las comunidades locales.Ante la posibilidad de contar con esta herramienta, la ejecutiva destacó que el turismo inteligente permite un beneficio a ambas partes, tanto a los usuarios como a los prestadores de servicios.\"La clave está en la posibilidad de prever, planificar y ajustar los recursos a la demanda. De esta forma, el turista obtendrá la experiencia más cercana posible a sus expectativas, al mismo tiempo que la oferta se adapta de la forma más eficiente a su demanda. Si las empresas turísticas pueden prever con la mayor precisión posible qué tipo y qué cantidad de demanda va a tener en un momento determinado, se minimizará el desperdicio de recursos, permitiendo una gestión más sostenible y eficiente.Al precisar cuál ha sido el efecto que haobservado España al aplicar esta herramienta, la ejecutivacomentó: \"Españaencabeza los rating año tras año de competitividad turística según Travel & Turism Report del Foro Económico Mundial y eso en un sector hiper competitivo como es el turismo.\"Esto no es fruto del azar sino un proceso de renovación donde el talento y la experiencia acumulada durante décadas se convierte en un continuo motor de innovación tecnológica\".Finalmente la ejecutiva destacó que este tipo de acciones garantizan que el turismo mexicano en España siga incrementándose, luego de que es bien sabido que el país europeo es preferido de los mexicanos; y comentó que hay cierta reciprocidad, toda vez que al español le gusta visitar nuestro país.\"El mexicano aprecia enormemente la oferta que presentaEspaña(gastronómica, cultural, educativa, deportiva, estilo de vida…) En 2024 México superó el millón de turistas aEspañapor primera vez.

In order to enrich the experiences offered to the walkers and at the same time, know the tastes and needs of tourists. Input, Peña defined intelligent tourism as a response that technology gives us to the challenges it faces today in tourism, in part generated by an excess of information that is necessary Tourism, mayors, states) and private (hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, museums, attraction parks, shopping centers, stadiums) \", in relation to that information. He also highlighted the convenience of intelligent tourism today, to meet and study the tourist and be able to meet their needs, since after the pandemic the tourists have become more demanding and demand to enjoy more complete experiences in their Trips. \"Knowing the behavior of the traveler, we can adjust the supply and demand, personalizing their trip and full experience. For example, for those tourists interested in visiting the archaeological ruins, the decision would have the capacity to organize its route incorporating the elements that most adapt to their interests in the most optimal way, according to the period of their stay. Local. Before the possibility of having this tool, the executive stressed that intelligent tourism allows a benefit to both parties, both users and service providers. \"The key is in the possibility of providing, planning and adjusting resources to demand. In this way, the tourist will obtain the closest possible experience to their expectations, at the same time that the supply adapts in the most efficient way to its demand. If tourism companies can foresee as precisely as possible what type and amount of demand will have at a given time, the waste of resources will be minimized, allowing a more sustainable and efficient management. At A hyper competitive sector such as tourism. \"This is not the result of chance but a renewal process where talent and experience accumulated for decades becomes a continuous engine of technological innovation.\" Finally the executive stressed that this type of actions guarantee that Mexican tourism in Spain continues to increase, after it is well known that the European country is preferred from Mexicans; Reciprocity, since Spanish likes to visit our country. \"The Mexican greatly appreciates the offer that is Spanish (gastronomic, cultural, educational, sports, lifestyle ...) in 2024 Mexico exceeded one million tourists Aespañor for the first time.

      "title": "El auge de la IA añade 150 mil mde a grandes empresas europeas del sector eléctrico",
      "description": "Cuatro de los grupos industriales más antiguos de Europa añadieron más de 150 mil millones de euros a su capitalización de mercado gracias a la creciente demanda de centros de datos impulsada por el auge de la inteligencia artificial (IA).Fabricantes europeos de todo tipo de productos, desde apagadores hasta medidores inteligentes, proporcionan los servidores y la infraestructura que alimentan los centros de datos para modelos de lenguaje de gran tamaño y computación en la nube. Productores tradicionales de equipos eléctricos como Legrand duplicaron sus ingresos gracias a los centros de datos en los últimos años.“No estamos invirtiendo 70 mil u 80 mil millones de dólares como Microsoft y Meta”, dijo Franck Lemery, director financiero de Legrand. “Pero sí proporcionamos los componentes y nuestro negocio crece en relación con ese gasto”.“La parte atractiva de la IA la lideran las compañías estadunidenses”, dijo Alex Cordovil, analista de Dell’Oro. Sin embargo, con algunas excepciones, los elementos básicos de la infraestructura los dominan los actores europeos.Los inversionistas detectaron el potencial. Desde el lanzamiento de ChatGPT en noviembre de 2022, las valoraciones de mercado de Schneider Electric, Siemens AG, ABB y Legrand —cuatro de los principales grupos europeos del sector— crecieron un total de 151 mil millones de euros, con un incremento de más de 60 por ciento en el caso de Siemens AG, que cotiza en la bolsa alemana.Los grupos continúan suministrando sistemas eléctricos a edificios residenciales y firmas industriales. Sin embargo, los centros de datos son su fuente de ingresos de mayor crecimiento, impulsados por el volumen de potencia computacional que requieren los modelos de inteligencia artificial, así como los videojuegos, la computación en la nube y el streaming.Este enfoque también los expone a grandes fluctuaciones en el precio de sus acciones, incluida una caída del mercado a principios de este año provocada por el lanzamiento del modelo de lenguaje de gran tamaño DeepSeek, de China, que, según sus creadores, se desarrolló con menor potencia de procesamiento. Según Cordovil, a los inversionistas también les preocupan las limitaciones de los sistemas de red y el suministro de energía.Sin embargo, grupos como Legrand le restan importancia a las preocupaciones, señalando la tendencia a largo plazo de una mayor demanda de procesamiento de datos, Dell’Oro espera que la inversión total en centros de datos aumente de casi 600 mil millones de dólares en 2025 a más de un billón de dólares para 2028.“Toda la turbulencia es relativa. Tenemos mucha, mucha confianza en el potencial de nuestra cartera”, añadió Lemery. “Tenemos que convivir con estos altibajos”.Schneider ElectricSchneider Electric es un proveedor líder en el sector de los centros de datos desde la adquisición de American Power Conversion por 6 mil 100 millones de dólares en 2006, lo que la coloca en una posición privilegiada para beneficiarse de la creciente demanda de electricidad.Los centros de datos representaron alrededor de 24 por ciento de sus pedidos en 2024, un aumento con respecto al 23 por ciento que representaban en 2023 y 19 por ciento en 2022, según la compañía.Inicialmente los inversionistas consideraron costoso el acuerdo con APC, pero permitió al grupo entrar en el mercado de servicios críticos de electricidad, que incluye los generadores necesarios para garantizar el suministro eléctrico de manera ininterrumpida a los centros de datos.Schneider está valorada en 127 mil 900 millones de euros, superando a la petrolera francesa TotalEnergies el año pasado, una señal de la transición global de los combustibles fósiles a la electricidad.La compañía ofrece desde software para el monitoreo de la infraestructura de los centros de datos, racks para servidores de almacenamiento y sistemas de refrigeración para evitar el sobrecalentamiento de las instalaciones de procesamiento de alta potencia. El año pasado adquirió una participación mayoritaria de 75 por ciento de Motivair, especialista en refrigeración líquida, por 850 millones de dólares.Esto le permitiría atender a clientes como Nvidia, cuyos servidores para sus chips de IA más potentes requerirían un proceso de refrigeración por agua más eficiente, en lugar de aire, según declaró el director ejecutivo de Schneider, Olivier Blum, en la junta general anual de la compañía.La IA se convirtió en un “cambio fundamental de paradigma para la infraestructura de tecnología de la información y eléctrica necesaria”, añadió.LegrandAl igual que Schneider y Siemens, Legrand, fabricante francés de enchufes y cables, se remonta al siglo XIX. En la década de 1900 comenzó a producir interruptores de luz a partir de productos de porcelana y madera, los aislantes de corriente eléctrica más conocidos entonces.Con sede aún en su histórica oficina central de Limoges, Legrand en los últimos años le dio prioridad al sector de los centros de datos, cuyos pedidos representaron 20 por ciento de las ventas en 2024, el doble que en 2019.“Puede representar más, para 2030, entre 20 y 25 por ciento; todavía no fijamos un objetivo preciso. Confiamos plenamente en que se trata de un sector vertical que seguirá creciendo con fuerza en los próximos años”, dijo Lemery.El grupo llevó a cabo 10 pequeñas adquisiciones el año pasado, seis de las cuales enfocaron en centros de datos.Sin embargo, Legrand, al igual que sus rivales industriales, opera un modelo de exportación con un elevado número de clientes estadunidenses, algo que los expone a los aranceles de Trump. Este mes, su director ejecutivo, Benoît Coquart, dijo que los impuestos de 50 a 60 por ciento sobre los productos chinos puede costarle a la compañía hasta 200 millones de dólares este año.ABBLa compañía eléctrica sueco-suiza ABB fabrica todo tipo de cosas, desde robótica hasta generadores de energía, pero en los últimos años sus ventas se inclinaron a los centros de datos.Morten Wierod, director ejecutivo de la compañía, dijo que ABB está “trabajando con muchos de los operadores de centros de datos más grandes del mundo para garantizar que cuenten con tecnologías seguras, confiables y energéticamente eficientes para manejar sus necesidades de energía”.En 2024 los pedidos de centros de datos representaron 15 por ciento de los 16 mil 400 millones de dólares en pedidos de la unidad de electrificación de ABB, en comparación con cerca de 9 por ciento dos años atrás. La electrificación representa casi la mitad de los 33 mil millones de dólares en ingresos anuales de ABB. Entre 2019 y 2023 los pedidos de centros de datos crecieron a una tasa anual promedio de 24 por ciento, acelerándose aún más el año pasado a medida que se intensificaba la carrera de la inteligencia artificial.Las ofertas de ABB para los operadores de centros de datos incluyen garantizar la disponibilidad y aumentar la eficiencia energética, además de actuar como baterías de respaldo para instalaciones completas. Sus sistemas, que proporcionan energía confiable, son más ecológicos que los generadores dísel tradicionales, según la empresa.Sin embargo, la exposición de la empresa a hyperscalers (hiperescaladores) provocó fluctuaciones en el mercado de valores, incluso después de informes de que Microsoft había cancelado algunos contratos de arrendamiento. EU es su mayor mercado en términos de ingresos por electrificación, con 50 por ciento.Siemens AGEl conglomerado alemán Siemens centra menos su atención en los centros de datos, pero aumentó la inversión en infraestructura para esta tecnología en su intento de alcanzar a competidores como Schneider Electric.“Siemens y ABB se enfocaron en otras áreas y ahora, en los últimos tres años, están aplicando sus capacidades\", dijo William Mackie, analista de Kepler Cheuvreux.El negocio global de centros de datos de la empresa, que impulsó  el reciente crecimiento del fabricante alemán, aumentó más de 45 por ciento, hasta alcanzar mil 300 millones de euros en el primer semestre del año fiscal.Pero la firma ha encontrado obstáculos para este crecimiento, atribuyendo una pausa en los pedidos de centros de datos de un “cliente hiperescalador” a una caída de 16 por ciento en los pedidos de productos eléctricos como controladores de microrredes.",

      "translatedTitle": "The AI ​​boom adds 150 thousand mode to large European companies in the electricity sector",
      "translatedDescription": "Four of the oldest industrial groups in Europe added more than 150 billion euros to their market capitalization thanks to the growing demand for data centers promoted by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). European manufacturers of all kinds of products, from offers to smart meters, provide servers and infrastructure that feed the data centers for large language models and cloud computing. Traditional producers of electrical equipment such as Legrand doubled their income thanks to the data centers in recent years. \"We are not investing 70 thousand or 80 billion dollars such as Microsoft and Meta,\" said Franck Lemery, Legrand Financial Director. \"But we do provide the components and our business grows in relation to that expense.\" However, with some exceptions, the basic elements of the infrastructure are dominated by European actors. Investors detected the potential. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the market assessments of Schneider Electric, Siemens AG, ABB and Legrand - four of the main European groups in the sector - grew a total of 151 billion euros, with an increase of more than 60 percent in the case of Siemens AG, which is quoted in the German stock exchange. Groups continue to supply electrical systems to residential buildings and industrial signs. However, data centers are their fastest growing source of income, driven by the volume of computational power that artificial intelligence models require, as well as video games, cloud computing and streaming. This approach also exposes them to large fluctuations in the price of their actions, including a market drop earlier this year cause creators, developed with less processing power. According to Cordovil, investors are also concerned about the limitations of network systems and energy supply. However, groups like Legrand subtract importance from concerns, pointing out the long -term trend of a greater demand for data processing, Dell’oro expects the total investment in data centers to increase from almost 600 billion dollars in 2025 to more than one billion dollars by 2028. “All turbulence is relative. Much, a lot of confidence in the potential of our portfolio, ”added Lemery. \"We have to live with these ups and downs.\" They represented in 2023 and 19 percent in 2022, according to the company. Investors considered the agreement with APC expensive, but allowed the group last year, a sign of the global transition of fossil fuels to electricity. The company offers from software for the monitoring of data centers infrastructure, racks for storage servers and cooling systems to avoid overheating high -power processing facilities. Last year he acquired a majority participation of 75 percent motiva, a specialist in liquid cooling, for 850 million dollars. This would allow him It became a \"fundamental change of paradigm for the information technology and electricity technology,\" he added as Schneider and Siemens, Legrand, French manufacturer of plugs and cables, dates back to the nineteenth century. In the 1900s it began to produce light switches from porcelain and wood products, the best known electric current insulators then, with the headquarters in its historic central office of Limoges, Legrand in recent years gave priority to the sector of the data centers, whose requests represented 20 percent of sales in 2024, twice as much in 2019. “It can represent more, by 2030, between 2030 We set a precise objective. Trump. This month, its executive director, Benoît Coquart, said that taxes from 50 to 60 percent on Chinese products can cost the company up to 200 million dollars this year. ABBL Larger data centers in the world to ensure that they have safe, reliable and energetically efficient technologies to handle their energy needs. ”In 2024 the requests for data centers represented 15 percent of the 16 thousand 400 million dollars in orders of the ABB Electrification Unit, compared to about 9 percent two years ago. Electrification represents almost half of the 33 billion dollars in annual income of ABB. Between 2019 and 2023 the requests for data centers grew at an average annual rate of 24 percent, accelerating further last year as the artificial intelligence career intensified. ABB offers for data centers operators include guaranteeing availability and increasing energy efficiency, in addition to acting as backrest batteries for complete facilities. Their systems, which provide reliable energy, are more ecological than traditional Díel generators, according to the company. However, the company's exposure to Hyperscalers (hyperscaladers) caused fluctuations in the stock market, even after reports that Microsoft had canceled some lease contracts. EU is its largest market in terms of electrification revenue, with 50 percent. Mackie, Kepler Cheuvreux analyst. The global business centers of the company, which promoted the recent growth of the German manufacturer, increased more than 45 percent, until reaching 1,300 million euros in the first half of the fiscal year. But the firm has found obstacles to this growth, attributing a pause in the requests of data centers of a “hyperscaling customer” to a fall of 16 percent in the requests of electrical products such as microredes controllers.",

Además de que tenía dosis de droga al momento de la captura.En cuanto a la víctima se trataba de Vladimir Gabino \"N\", quien supuestamente es originario del estado de San Luis Potosí, donde en 2011 fue detenido por agentes de la Fiscalía General de la República (FGR), quienes lo identificaron como integrante de Los Zetas, brazo armado del Cártel del Golfo. Tras salir de prisión, el hombre se fue a vivir a la capital del país.Allegados de Brugada: Ximena y JoséAlrededor de las 07:00 horas del martes 20 de mayo, un hombre armado asesinó a los colaboradores de Clara Brugada, sobre la Calzada de Tlalpan, a la altura de la colonia Moderna, de la alcaldía Benito Juárez.Según las investigaciones del caso, el agresor esperó a que ambos funcionarios públicos se reunieran para ejecutar el ataque, el cual estaba previsto a que ocurriera el miércoles 14 de mayo, en el mismo punto, donde Ximena y José se encontraban todas las mañanas antes de irse a trabajar.Posteriormente, el presunto civil armado escapó a bordo de una motocicleta, con apoyo de al menos otras tres personas que realizaron dos cambios de vehículo para abandonar el perímetro de la Ciudad de México.La Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana (SSC) de la Ciudad de México informó que gracias a los análisis de las cámaras de video se identificó a cuatro personas presuntamente involucradas en el crimen, de los cuales dos ya fueron exhibidos en el programa C4 en Alerta: el agresor y el hombre que conducía la motocicleta en la que escaparon.Sobre este caso, las autoridades capitalinas lograron asegurar la motocicleta y dos vehículos utilizados en la huida.

Testigos indicaron que los agresores primero encararon a las víctimas, luego les dispararon y finalmente escaparon de la escena del crimen.Lo que pudo corroborar MILENIO es que una de las víctimas arribó a altas horas de la noche a la vecindad donde fue atacado para pedir ayuda, ya que lo venían siguiendo; sin embargo, cuando un hombre salió para ver qué pasaba fueron embestidos a balazos por los motociclistas.Meses después se supo que uno de los implicados fue detenido tras arribar a un hospital con una herida de bala en la mandíbula.Motosicarios a domicilio: de pistolas a bombas molotovA finales de febrero, policías capitalinos arribaron a un inmueble ubicado entre las avenidas Telecomunicaciones y Enrique Contel, de la colonia Chinam Pac de Juárez, en la alcaldía Iztapalapa, donde observaron a un hombre persiguiendo a otro hasta que alcanzó a dispararle en el pecho.El presunto agresor le explicó a los oficiales que le disparó a la persona porque minutos antes arribó a su domicilio en una motocicleta y atacó a balazos de forma directa a dos mujeres y un hombre.Un mes antes, cámaras de seguridad de la alcaldía Álvaro Obregón captaron el momento exacto en el que dos personas, a bordo de una motocicleta, arribaron hasta la entrada de un restaurante y, sin bajarse del vehículo aventaron lo que parece ser unabomba molotov al interior del establecimiento.Las imágenes captaron a los dos presuntos agresores arribando al restaurante en una motocicleta. Posteriormente, el conductor se frenó justo enfrente del establecimiento, mientras que la otra persona le prendió fuego a una botella para lanzarla directamente al interior del inmueble, de donde salieron corriendo todos los comensales.El periodista Carlos Jiménez informó que uno de los dueños originales del restaurante se peleó con su amigo, razón por la que se salió del negocio con su respectiva parte, sin embargo, el propietario actual del local lo responsabilizó del ataque directo.Así fue el ataque con bomba molotov▶ ¡Con esos amigos para que quieres enemigos!

Tenemos información de lo que pasó, pero la iremos actualizando como tengamos resultados concretos\".Poco después de las 19:00 horas, Alejandra Barrios Richard, madre de Diana Sánchez Barrios, responsabilizó al grupo delictivo de La Unión Tepito por el ataque que sufrió su hija.“Ya la venían siguiendo y cuando ella se baja de la moto la atacan, venía con mi sobrino que está hospitalizado (la víctima que murió meses después). Ella iba a Motolinia porque ella tiene un negocio de lentes (...)

Además, fue parte de la Contraloría General de la Ciudad de México.​Operan en bola: ni La Unión Tepito se salvaA finales del año pasado, se registró un ataque armado contra dos hombres presuntos integrantes de La Unión Tepito sobre Circuito Interior, en la alcaldía Venustiano Carranza.En el video compartido en redes sociales, se observa cómo las víctimas caen de una motocicleta en los carriles centrales de la vía rápida tras un ataque armado. Ya sobre el piso, un vehículo gris se acerca a ellos.Sin embargo, segundos más tarde, otra motocicleta se acercó a los heridos para rematarlos a tiros al menos nueve veces. Al verificar que no se encontraban con vida, huyeron del lugar con rumbo desconocido.En 2024, también se reportó que un hombre fue asesinado a balazos en el barrio de San Mateo Xalpa, en la alcaldía Xochimilco.El ataque ocurrió en Prolongación Guadalupe y Ramírez, en el callejón de Chabacanos, donde informes policiales refirieron que tres hombres en motocicleta interceptaron a la víctima, de alrededor de 40 a 45 años, cuando se encontraba manejando un taxi.Atentan contra libertad de expresión: Ciro Gómez LeyvaProbablemente el ataque más mediático en los últimos años ha sido el de Ciro Gómez Leyva,periodista que el 15 de diciembre del 2022, denunció que hombres a abordo de una motocicleta lo intenatron asesinar a balazos cerca de su domicilio.Las autoridades confirmaron que no se trató de un intento de robo o secuestro, sino de un ataque directo.\"Alguien creo y eso me lo confirmaron tanto los policías como los ministerios públicos, no era un robo, no era un intento de secuestro, todo indica que alguien quiso matarme anoche”, aseguró Ciro Leyva.Una de las personas detenidas por el atentado contra el periodista es Armando Escárcega Valdez, El Patrón, presunto autor intelectual del intento de homicidio.De las personas detenidas, también destacan cinco mujeres.RM",

      "description": "El conflicto armado entre el grupo terrorista Hamás e Israel, cumple 600 días este miércoles, luego de que el 7 de octubre de 2023, milicianos palestinos lanzaron un ataque sorpresa contra Israel, en el que murieron 695 civiles y tomaron como rehenes a 251 personas, de los que todavía 58 siguen secuestrados en la Franja de Gaza.\"El pueblo israelí entiende que tiene que haber guerra y que Hamás tiene que terminar, pero por otro lado, la fuerza dentro de la Franja de Gaza pone en peligro a los secuestrados.\"Y de hecho, la fuerza militar solo trajo a 8 (rehenes) y a otros 40 cuerpos, pero las familias dicen que la única manera de traerlos con vida es a través de la negociación, que tiene un precio\", dijo Marisa Broitman, guía voluntaria del Foro de las familias de secuestrados y desaparecidos.\"Pero no hay precio para una mamá que quiere volver a ver y abrazar a su hijo. Es una disyuntiva, damos terroristas o presos. Las familias quieren a cualquier precio volver a ver a sus hijos\", añadió en entrevista con MILENIO.Toman plaza para exigir negociaciones de liberaciónUna plaza pública, frente al Ministerio de Defensa israelí en la bulliciosa ciudad de Tel Aviv,  ha sido convertida en la \"Plaza de los Secuestrados\".En el lugar, familiares  y amigos de las víctimas han colocado fotografías de los rehenes, con la leyenda en hebreo: \"No me dejen atrás\", exigiendo que las  negociaciones continúen para poder liberar a los 20 rehenes que se estima, aún continúan con vida y recuperar los cuerpos de quienes han fallecido.\"Después de dos negociaciones, una en noviembre de 2023 y otra en enero febrero del 2025, hay todavía 58 secuestrados en la Franja de Gaza, alrededor de 20 con vida y los demás sabemos que no están con vida, pero las familias reclaman porque a los muertos para poder enterrarlos\", dijo Marisa Broitman, activista y profesora.La plaza entera ha sido tomada para exigir la liberación de los secuestrados por medio de diversas instalaciones artísticas, en las que han colaborado incluso los rehenes desaparecidos.Se ha expuesto un piano al aire libre que recuerda la música que una de las víctimas solía tocar, además de cientos de fotografías de los desaparecidos, colgando de los árboles, en las paredes, vallas y edificios, y una colorida obra con la palabra \"esperanza\" en hebreo.\"Quien pide que pongan esta obra aquí es Luis Har, argentino secuestrado el 7 de octubre junto con sus familiares; las tres mujeres salen libres en la primera liberación. Luis y Fernando van a ser liberados por una operación militar en febrero de 2024, y los cinco que estaban en el cuarto de seguridad esa mañana del 7 de octubre y que estuvieron en la Franja de Gaza volvieron a estar juntos en la tierra de Israel.\"Luis Har dijo 'yo nunca perdí la esperanza de que íbamos a estar nuevamente juntos, y si yo no perdí las esperanzas, nadie las tiene que perder'\", parafraseó Marisa Broitman.Relojes como recordatorio del límite de tiempoEn la \"Plaza de los Secuestrados\" también fueron colocados un reloj de arena tamaño monumental y uno digital que va marcando el número de días que los rehenes continúan secuestrados.\"Nadie imaginó, cuando pusieron este reloj digital, que íbamos a llegar a los 600 días. El reloj de arena nos marca que el tiempo es un recurso limitado, que los secuestrados sufren y mueren\".​Otra instalación escenifica uno de los túneles donde se mantienen secuestrados, según los relatos de las personas que han sido liberadas.Al entrar se escuchan golpes, cadenas y hasta explosivos, y con decenas de botellas con orina regadas y pintas en las paredes, que \"te hacen sentir lo que viven los secuestrados, que están en túneles, debajo de tierra, algunos en jaula, algunos esposados y demás\", dijo la activista.ksh",

      "description": "La magistrada federal, Luz Elba de la Torre Orozco, quien actualmente se encuentra en campaña para refrendar su cargo en la elección judicial del 1 de junio, tiene en sus manos una de las resoluciones más delicadas de los últimos años: revocar la suspensión a una orden de aprehensión contra presuntos artífices de la 'narcofosa'más grande encontrada en los últimos años, la de Salvatierra, Guanajuato, donde fueron hallados 80 cuerpos.Una resolución de la magistrada del Tribunal de Justicia de Guanajuato, Gabriela Berenice Pinedo Amador, está siendo revisada por la magistrada federal debido a posibles inconsistencias en su determinación de liberar a personas ligadas al Cártel de Santa Rosa de Lima.Los abogados del Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez, quienes llevan el caso de la familia Barajas Piña, padre y madre de una de las jóvenes halladas en el cementerio clandestino, denuncian “irregularidades” en el proceso debido a que “viola el derecho al acceso a la justicia y a la participación de las víctimas”.Los Barajas temen represalias de los delincuentes ligados al Cártel de Santa Rosa de Lima, y acusan “corrupción” en el sistema de justicia local.A los profesores José y María, primero les desaparecieron a su hija Lupita y sólo unos meses después, cuando su otro hijo, Javier, se sumó a las labores de búsqueda, también se lo asesinaron. A estos atroces hechos se le suma que ahora una sala penal en Guanajuato dictó una resolución inaudita: la liberación de los artífices tanto de las desapariciones como de la fosa irregular. La Cuarta Sala Penal del Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Estado de Guanajuato suspendió la orden de aprehensión en contra de Carlos Manuel Calderón Cardoso y de Julio César Zamudio Villagómez, quienes según las investigaciones habrían sido parte del grupo criminal que opera en la zona del Cártel de Santa Rosa de Lima. Es esta organización criminal que fundara el narcotraficante José Antonio Yépez Ortiz, conocido como El Marro, la que habría enterrado a 80 personas en la fosa clandestina dentro de un predio en una colonia totalmente habitada en el municipio de Salvatierra, un pueblo mágico. Esta se convertiría en la sepultura irregular más grande encontrada durante los últimos años. Primero Lupita, luego su hermanoLa fosa fue descubierta tras la desaparición de Guadalupe Barajas Piña, ‘Lupita’, una joven profesora que fue secuestrada el 29 de febrero de 2020 cuando salió de su casa hacia el centro de Salvatierra. Ese día empezaría la búsqueda por parte de sus padres, los profesores Javier Barajas y María Piña.De hecho sería una llamada telefónica en marzo del 2020 a la profesora María del Tránsito Piña la que revelaría una verdad atroz: “a su hija se la llevó El Grillo y El Chore”, le informó una voz anónima, distorsionada, que colgó antes de que la señora pudiera hacer preguntas. Ahora se sabe que eran personas vinculadas al cártel. La profesora recibiría una segunda llamada, la definitiva, tres meses después a las 16:00 horas en un día de junio:“Se lo prometí a la maestra Lupita. Busque detrás de la Bachoco”, le soltó una mujer a la profesora María del Tránsito. “¿En dónde? ¿En Celaya?”. La mujer le respondió que afuera de una fábrica de huevos a un costado de una aceitera y un rastro en Salvatierra, Guanajuato, en los márgenes del Río Lerma. “Busque y va hallar algo”, agregó y colgó. En octubre de ese año los profesores, junto con un grupo de familiares de personas desaparecidas y las autoridades, encontrarían 80 cuerpos en un espacio de 600 metros cuadrados. Desde ese día la familia siguió buscando y encontró más fosas clandestinas. La prueba de que los hallazgos enfurecieron al cártel es que el 29 de mayo de 2021, Francisco Javier, su hijo, fue asesinado y los señores Barajas tuvieron que exiliarse. ​En 2023, finalmente inició un juicio doloroso, que parecía que sentaría un precedente judicial en el tema de las fosas clandestinas en México. La Fiscalía local encontraría que entre los artífices de la fosa de Salvatierra se encontrabanCarlos Manuel Calderón Cardoso y Julio César Zamudio Villagómez, vinculados al cártel que opera en la zona. Sin embargo, desde el pasado mes de enero el proceso judicial se ha vuelto una pesadilla para la familia Barajas.Una liberación sospechosa Las alarmas se prendieron el 9 abril de 2025, cuando los profesores tuvieron conocimiento de que Calderón Cardoso había sido detenido por las autoridades. Los abogados del Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez, quienes acompañan a Javier y María, tuvieron conocimiento casi de manera inmediata que la Cuarta Sala Penal del Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Estado de Guanajuato había concedido un recurso que suspendía la orden de aprehensión en su contra. La resolución de la magistrada Gabriela Berenice Pinedo Amador les pareció inaudita y sin sustento, puesto que se basó en el artículo 191 de la Ley de Amparo, que no se relaciona con el debido proceso y no ordena la liberación de nadie. La irregularidad en la liberación llegó a tal grado que se emitió sin notificarles a las víctimas, “violando su derecho al acceso a la justicia” e impidiendo su participación, acusa el Centro Pro. “El desplazamiento forzado que viven los profesores impide que ejerzan sus derechos directamente y dependen de las autoridades, que han mostrado falta de coordinación y opacidad (entre la Fiscalía, la Comisión de Víctimas y el Poder Judicial de Guanajuato)”. Lo mismo sucedió con otro de los imputados en los crímenes, Julio César Zamudio Villagómez, quien fue liberado tras interponer un amparo para lograr la misma suspensión en su orden de arresto. Pasean como sin nadaLos profesores realmente están desconcertados: no entienden cómo, pese a todas las evidencias que existen en contra de los dos integrantes del Cártel de Santa Rosa de Lima, la magistrada Gabriela Berenice Pinedo Amador pudo dar pie a esta liberación, que además les pone en riesgo. La profesora María del Tránsito dice en entrevista con MILENIO que han sido días de mucha angustia y de impotencia al presenciar tanta impunidad. Que las medidas en favor de quienes enterraron a su hija en esa fosa y después asesinaron a su hijo Javier los deja en total indefensión y a merced de los criminales. “Andan fuera los dos [inculpados], y saber que ellos han sido premiados con una boleta de libertad…. con la mano en la cintura, que nos hagan esto deja a nuestro corazón con mucho dolor y mucha impotencia y emociones encontradas. Los compañeros en Salvatierra de nuestro colectivo (de búsqueda) y nuestras familias están en riesgo”, dice. Dice que han recibido información de que Carlos Manuel Calderón Cardoso se pasea por todo Salvatierra como si nada, lo que tiene aterrorizada a la comunidad y a las familias que continúan en la búsqueda de sus familiares en las diferentes fosas clandestinas del lugar. El profesor Javier Barajas también está anonadado: no puede creer que esto esté ocurriendo. Dice que las autoridades nunca les avisaron que fueron liberados a pesar del riesgo que corren ellos, sus familias y los colectivos. “No queremos venganza, queremos justicia (...) no es posible que haya premio para individuos que se dedican a desaparecer personas como si fueran chicles o dulces”, dice a este diario con indignación y la voz quebrada. Señala que las personas que desaparecieron a su hija también atacaron a otras 79 personas, de las cuales 64 ya han sido identificadas. “Hay muchas amedrentaciones y sobornos tanto para fiscalías como para personas de alto nivel, hay mucha corrupción e intereses personales, a mí no me queda duda, no puedo decirlo de otra manera. Cualquier persona sensata que vea lo que está pasando lo pensará de igual manera”, apunta Barajas.Caso a revisiónCésar Contreras, litigante del Centro de Derechos Humanos y quien acompaña a los profesores en este caso, coincide en que es un asunto inaudito ya que es una medida de impunidad y que la ley era muy clara y no estaba sujeto a interpretación. Es claramente una violación a la ley, una medida que propicia la impunidad y pone en riesgo la vida y la integridad de los profesores, de las familias y, en general, de la comunidad de Salvatierra. ​Es por eso que el 8 de mayo se abrió un incidente por exceso en el cumplimiento de la suspensión de la orden de aprehensión de Carlos Manuel Calderón Cardoso, ante el Primer Tribunal Colegiado en Materia Penal del Circuito Judicial de Guanajuato, esto es, del Poder Judicial de la Federación (PJF).Dicho incidente tiene como finalidad que se determine que el dictado de este tipo de medidas suspensivas dentro de un juicio de amparo directo, como en este caso es la libertad de los presuntos responsables, se considere inusitado y excesivo con los límites previstos en la Ley de Amparo, por lo que la autoridad debe corregir esta determinación para efecto de que el imputado quede a disposición del Tribunal Colegiado, permitiendo con ello su reaprehensión.El proyecto de resolución de este incidente está a cargo de la magistrada Luz Elba de la Torre Orozco, adscrita al Primer Tribunal Colegiado en materia Penal del Decimosexto Circuito con sede en Guanajuato, cuya decisión podría regresar a prisión a este integrante del Cártel de Santa Rosa de Lima.La juzgadora está actualmente en campaña en la elección judicial, busca mantenerse en el cargo por medio del voto. Ella es magistrada federal debido a que el Tribunal Colegiado es parte del Poder Judicial de la Federación.La defensa de los agredidos paralelamente prepara acciones legales para conseguir que Julio César Zamudio Villagómez regrese a prisión.",

      "translatedDescription": "The federal magistrate, Luz Elba de la Torre Orozco, who is currently in the campaign to endorse her position in the Judicial Choice of June 1, has in her hands one of the most delicate resolutions of recent years: revoke the suspension to an arrest warrant against alleged architects of the 'narcofosa' largest found in recent years, that of Salvatierra, Guanajuato, where 80 bodies were found. Magistrate of the Court of Justice of Guanajuato, Gabriela Berenice Pinedo Amador, is being reviewed by the federal magistrate due to possible inconsistencies in their determination to free people linked to the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel. The lawyers of the Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, who have the case of the Barajas Piña family, father and mother of one of the young women found in the clandestine cemetery, They denounce \"irregularities\" in the process because \"violates the right to access to justice and the participation of the victims.\" The decks will reprose the criminals linked to the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, and accuse \"corruption\" in the local justice system. To the professors José and María, they first disappeared to their daughter Lupita and only a few months later, when his other son, Javier, They killed him. To these atrocious facts, it is added that now a criminal hall in Guanajuato issued an unprecedented resolution: the release of the architects of both the disappearances and the irregular fossa. The Fourth Criminal Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of the State of Guanajuato suspended the arrest warrant against Carlos Manuel Calderón Cardoso and Julio César Zamudio Villagómez, who according to the investigations would have been part of the criminal group that operates in the area of ​​the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel. It is this criminal organization that founded the drug trafficker José Antonio Yépez Ortiz, known as El Marro, which would have buried 80 people in the clandestine pit within a property in a colony totally inhabited in the municipality of Salvatierra, a magical town. This would become the largest irregular grave found in recent years. First Lupita, then her hermanola pit was discovered after the disappearance of Guadalupe Barajas Piña, ‘Lupita’, a young teacher who was kidnapped on February 29, 2020 when she left her house towards the center of Salvatierra. That day the search by their parents would begin, the professors Javier Barajas and María Piña. Now it is known that they were people linked to the cartel. The teacher would receive a second call, the final one, three months later at 4:00 p.m. on June: \"I promised the teacher Lupita. Looking behind the Bachoco,\" a woman released Professor María del Transit. \"Where? In Celaya?\" The woman replied that outside an egg factory to the side of an oil and a trail in Salvatierra, Guanajuato, on the margins of the Lerma River. \"Look and find something,\" he added and hung. In October of that year, the teachers, together with a group of relatives of missing persons and the authorities, would find 80 bodies in a space of 600 square meters. Since that day the family kept looking for and found more clandestine graves. The proof that the findings enraged the cartel is that on May 29, 2021, Francisco Javier, his son, was killed and Mr. Barajas had to exile. In 2023, he finally initiated a painful trial, which seemed that a judicial precedent would sit on the subject of clandestine graves in Mexico. The local prosecution would find that among the architects of the Salvatierra fossa were Manuel Calderón Cardoso and Julio César Zamudio Villagómez, linked to the cartel that operates in the area. However, since last January the judicial process has become a nightmare for the Barajas family. A suspicious liberation alarms were caught on April 9, 2025, when teachers were aware that Calderón Cardoso had been arrested by the authorities. The lawyers of the Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, who accompany Javier and María, were immediately aware that the Fourth Criminal Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of the State of Guanajuato had granted an appeal that suspended the arrest warrant against him. The resolution of Judge Gabriela Berenice Pinedo Amador seemed unheard of and without sustenance, since it was based on article 191 of the Amparo Law, which does not relate to due process and does not order anyone's release. The irregularity in liberation reached such a degree that it was issued without notifying the victims, \"violating their right to access to justice\" and preventing their participation, accuses the Pro Center. \"The forced displacement that teachers live prevents them from exercising their rights directly and depend on the authorities, which have shown lack of coordination and opacity (between the Prosecutor's Office, the Commission of Victims and the Judicial Power of Guanajuato).\" The same happened with another of the accused in the crimes, Julio César Zamudio Villagómez, who was released after filing an amparo to achieve the same suspension in his arrest order. They walk like Nadalos Teachers are really bewildered: they do not understand how, despite all the evidence that exists against the two members of the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, magistrate Gabriela Berenice Pinedo Amador could give rise to this liberation, which also puts them at risk. Professor Maria del Traffic says in an interview with Milenio that they have been days of great anguish and helplessness by witnessing so much impunity. That the measures in favor of those who buried their daughter in that pit and then murdered their son Javier leaves them in total defenselessness and at the mercy of the criminals. \"They walk out both [accused], and know that they have been awarded with a freedom ballot ... with the hand at the waist, that they do this leaves our heart with a lot of pain and much helplessness and emotions found. The classmates in Salvatierra of our collective (search) and our families are at risk,\" he says. He says that they have received information that Carlos Manuel Calderón Cardoso walks around Salvatierra as if nothing, which has the community terrified and families who continue in the search for their relatives in the different clandestine graves of the place. Professor Javier Barajas is also stunned: he cannot believe that this is happening. He says that the authorities never told them that they were released despite the risk that they, their families and the groups. \"We do not want revenge, we want justice (...) It is not possible that there is a prize for individuals who are dedicated to disappearing people as if they were gum or sweets,\" he tells this newspaper with indignation and the broken voice. He points out that the people who disappeared to their daughter also attacked 79 people, of which 64 have already been identified. \"There are many intimidations and bribes for both prosecutors and high -level people, there is a lot of impunity and that the law was very clear and was not subject to interpretation. It is clearly a violation of the law, a measure that encourages impunity and puts the life and integrity of teachers, families and, in general, of the Salvatierra community at risk. That is why on May 8 an incident was opened due to compliance with the suspension of the arrest warrant of Carlos Manuel Calderón Cardos The alleged perpetrators are considered unusual and excessive with the limits provided for in the Amparo Law, so that the authority must correct this determination for the purpose that the accused is available to the Collegiate Court, thereby allowing its re -apprehension. The draft resolution of this incident is in charge of magistrate Luz Elba de la Torre Orozco, attached to the first collegiate court in criminal matters of the six Guanajuato, whose decision could return to prison to this member of the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel. The judge is currently in the judicial election, seeks to remain in office through vote. She is a Federal Magistrate because the Collegiate Court is part of the Judicial Power of the Federation. The defense of the assaulted assaulally prepares legal actions to ensure that Julio César Zamudio Villagómez returns to prison.",

      "title": "Estreñimiento, el terror de los mexicanos, doloroso y preocupante",
      "description": "En México el estreñimiento resulta bastante frecuente y se caracteriza por la dificultad para defecar al menos tres veces a la semana.¿Cómo identificar que tengo estreñimiento?Muchas veces se acompaña de dolor y de distensión abdominal, “como si trajera un globo por dentro que aprieta el pantalón” y por gases socialmente molestos.“El dolor abdominal puede ser a veces leve, pero en otras ocasiones es tan intenso que evita que la persona efectúe sus actividades diarias como estudiante, como ama de casa o como trabajador, de hecho, propicia un alto índice de ausentismo laboral”, explicó Edwin Ornelas Escobedo, gastroenterólogo y endoscopia gastrointestinal en el Hospital General de México Dr. Eduardo Liceaga.Además, destacó que el estreñimiento se define como una disminución en la frecuencia de las evacuaciones fecales.\"Un paciente puede sospechar que tiene estreñimiento cuando no tiene por lo menos tres evacuaciones placenteras y completas en una semana, sin necesidad de recurrir a maniobras como pujar, introducirse un dedo, ponerse edemas, supositorios\", comentó.Por su parte mencionó que evacuar una bola dura como piedra habla también de estreñimiento.Sangre, presente durante evacuación de hecesExisten estudios que reportan que hasta un 25 por ciento de la población tiene estreñimiento con síntomas graves y la severidad dependerá de la edad e historial del paciente ya que, algunos, comentó, arrojan sangre en las heces, lo cual, es un referente para solicitar atención médica inmediata.“Es muy frecuente escuchar entre nuestros pacientes que evacuan con sangre y lo atribuyen a que hicieron un coraje, o que comieron algo que les cayó mal, y como no sienten ninguna molestia, no acuden a solicitar ayuda médica inmediata\", recordó.\"Esto es una urgencia gastrointestinal y regularmente cuando se presenta una segunda o tercera evacuación pueden poner en peligro su vida”, destacó.La presencia de sangre roja fresca abundante, detalló, puede ser un síntoma característico de padecer cáncer de colon en etapa avanzada; cuando existen reducidas probabilidades de tratamiento médico, quirúrgico o farmacológico. “Si una persona evacúa con sangre, y no lo hacía de manera regular, puede tener cáncer de colon”, subrayó el experto cuyo tema será clave dentro de la mesa de análisis Del intestino al cerebro,un eje directo, que organiza Milenio Foros y se llevará a cabo el 29 de mayo a las 17:00 horas en la Ciudad de México.“Nunca debes evacuar con sangre. Y si sucede tienes que ir al médico lo más pronto posible. Jamás es normal evacuar sangre”, agregó.Otros focos rojos del estreñimientoLos datos de alerta, añadió, también se acompañan de pérdida de peso no intencionada, es decir, de cinco a diez kilos en el último mes; verse enfermo, es decir, pálido.“El mensaje es claro, así como a las mujeres se les dice que hay que hacerse la autoexploración física para encontrar anormalidades en los senos, pues igual todos los días, cada que vamos al baño tenemos que ver nuestras evacuaciones. Y si alguna vez nuestras evacuaciones contienen sangre, tenemos que ir con el médico, específicamente con un especialista, un gastroenterólogo”, aseveró Escobedo.Tu salud es prioridad, las enfermedades pueden ser preventivasEs importante también hacerse estudios, sobre todo, cuando hay antecedentes de cáncer en la familia.“Hay que hacerse estudios de sangre, de la tiroides, saber si el paciente cursa con otra enfermedad como diabetes, lo cual, es bastante frecuente y realizarse, incluso, una colonoscopía, que implica introducir un tubito con una cámara y revisar por dentro que no haya lesiones, eso marca la diferencia entre la vida y la muerte”, destacó Escobedo.El gastroenterólogo informó que el 90 por ciento del cáncer de colon es genéticamente transmisible. Solo hay un pequeño porcentaje que no se deriva de ellos, pero es el menor.\"Entonces, por ejemplo, si al familiar se le detectó cáncer de colon a los 56 años, toda la familia directa debe hacerse una colonoscopía diez años antes, a los 45 o 46 años de manera obligatoria, para modificar el rumbo fatal de la enfermedad”, puntualizó.En ese proceso se debe de descartar también que el estreñimiento, en el caso de los diabéticos, se deba a un inadecuado control metabólico, es muy común que los pacientes con hipotiroidismo se estriñen de manera más frecuente.Hay casos que se relacionan con la ingesta de ciertos medicamentos. El especialista dejó en claro que el estreñimiento no necesariamente se relaciona con cáncer o con patologías crónicas, pero sí con el tipo de estilo de vida que se desea tener. El defecar de manera “adecuada, satisfactoria, placentera, que no se quede la persona con ganas”, nada tiene que ver con la cantidad de veces que se acude al día al baño, algunos lo hacen tres veces o más, cada vez que se alimentan.Lo que se debe de considerar, aclaró, es la consistencia de la evacuación, la cual, subrayó,“debe ser blanda y debe tener la forma de un plátano o de una salchicha”.¿Cómo evitar el estreñimiento?Para evitar el estreñimiento es necesario tener una dieta rica en fibra, en frutas, verduras, cereales y granos, algunos, “pueden recurrir a las fibras sintéticas, pero eso ya es bajo una prescripción médica, después de una evaluación”.También es necesario tomar dos litros de agua a diario y hacer actividad física, idealmente 40 minutos al día, cuatro o cinco veces por semana. “Si el paciente, por el motivo que usted me diga, no puede o no quiere cambiar esto, bueno, tendrán que hacer medidas de ajuste, pero eso solo lo hace un médico”, destacó.KL",

      "translatedDescription": "In Mexico, constipation is quite frequent and is characterized by the difficulty in defecating at least three times a week. How do I identify that I have constipation? Many times it is accompanied by pain and abdominal relax Diarios as a student, as a housewife or as a worker, in fact, propitiates a high rate of labor absenteeism, ”said Edwin Ornelas Escobedo, gastroenterologist and gastrointestinal endoscopy at the General Hospital of Mexico Dr. Eduardo Liceaga. At least three pleasant and complete evacuations in a week, without the need to resort to maneuvers such as bidding, entering a finger, putting edema, suppositories, \"he commented on his part, he mentioned that evacuating a hard ball as a stone also speaks of constipation. It will depend on the patient's age and history since, some, he commented, throw blood into the stool, which is a reference to request immediate medical care. “It is very common Gastrointestinal and regularly when a second or third evacuation occurs, they can endanger their life, ”he said. The presence of abundant fresh red blood, he explained, can be a characteristic symptom of suffering from colon cancer in an advanced stage; when there are reduced probabilities of medical, surgical or pharmacological treatment. \"If a person evacuates with blood, and did not do it on a regular basis, he can have colon cancer,\" said the expert whose theme will be key within the intestine analysis table to the brain, a direct axis, organized by Millennium forums and will take place on May 29 at 5:00 p.m. Blood, ”he added. Another red bulbs of the constipation of alert data, he added, are also accompanied by unintended weight loss, that is, five to ten kilos in the last month; Seeing yourself sick, that is, pale. \"The message is clear, as well as women are told that physical self -exploration must be done to find abnormalities in the breasts, because the same every day, every day we go to the bath They can also be important to do studies, above all, when there is a history of cancer in the family. “Blood studies, thyroid, knowing if the patient is with another disease such as diabetes, which is quite frequent and even performing a colonoscopy, which implies introducing a tube with a chamber and checking inside that there are no injuries, that makes the difference between life and death,” Gastroenterologist reported that 90 percent of colon cancer is genetically transmissible. There is only a small percentage that does not derive from them, but it is the least. \"So, for example, if the family was detected colon cancer at age 56, the entire direct family must be done a colonoscopy ten years before, at 45 or 46 years in a mandatory way, to modify the fatal course of the disease,” he said. In that process it must also be ruled out that constipation, in the case of the diabetics To an inadequate metabolic control, it is very common for patients with hypothyroidism to strive more frequently. There are cases that are related to the intake of certain medications. The specialist made it clear that constipation is not necessarily related to cancer or chronic pathologies, but with the type of lifestyle you want to have. The defecate in a \"adequate, satisfactory, pleasant, that the person with desire\" has nothing to do with the number of times that is going to the bathroom, some do it three times or more, every time they feed on, what they must consider, which is to consider, clarified, is the consistency of the evacuation, which, it stressed, “must be soft and must have the form of a banana or a banana Salachicha. ”How to avoid constipation? To avoid constipation, it is necessary to have a diet rich in fiber, in fruits, vegetables, cereals and grains, some,“ they can resort to synthetic fibers, but that is already under a medical prescription, after an evaluation ”. It is also necessary to take two liters of water daily and do physical activity, ideally 40 minutes a day, four or five times per week. \"If the patient, for the reason you tell me, cannot or do not want to change this, well, they will have to make adjustment measures, but only a doctor does that,\" he said.",

      "title": "Karina Sofía, la cantante regia respaldada por Gustavo Santaolalla",
      "description": "En el terreno musical,Karina Sofía es una artista que escribe en base a lo que siente, no a lo que ve. Una descripción que salió de boca deGustavo Santaolalla, el reconocido compositor y productor argentino que la respaldó en su disco debut, La reina del cañón.En entrevista con MILENIO, la originaria de Monterrey se dice \"muy contenta y agradecida\" por la salida de este material, que trabajó durante cinco arduos años.\"Mostrárselo a mis papás, que llevan cinco años esperando, fue increíble. Han estado conmigo a lo largo de todo, me han apoyado muchísimo... Saben la lucha constante para sacar este disco, que ha sido mi sueño\", cuenta vía Zoom, esbozando una gran sonrisa.La reina del cañónEn sus 11 temas, La reina del cañónse muestra ecléctico con su fusión de folclore, rock, pop y regional- al que aclara no adoptó por tendencia, sino por interés genuino -. Y sintetiza emociones que salieron \"directamente del corazón\" de su creadora, quien comenzó a componer durante la pandemia de covid-19.\"Lo veo como una representación de quien soy como persona y artista. Sónicamente lo refleja. También el mundo visual con los vídeos. Desde un principio tenía la idea de hacer un disco de concepto con una historia, una línea, un arco. Y se logró\".Aunque si tuviera que resumir la esencia del material en una palabra, Karina, que fue nominada en la pasada edición de los premios Lo Nuestro dentro de la categoría Artista Femenina del Año, no vacila: \"empoderamiento\".\"Me gustaría que a la gente, cuando escuche el disco, si está buscando empoderamiento, sobresalir, sanar algo o cualquier tipo de duelo, le ayude\".Revela que, a largo plazo, le gustaría hacer una película sobre La reina del cañón, porque \"hay una historia que escribí del personaje\". Y a corto plazo ya trabaja en algo: \"Soy fan de los cómics, entonces estamos haciendo uno y la idea es traer lo visual del cómic al escenario\".— Con la salida del disco y todas las posibilidades que se te han abierto a partir de eso, ¿cómo interiorizas el éxito?— Lo trato de encontrar en los pasos chiquitos, porque como artistas nos comparamos con otra gente, entonces puedes estar viviendo el éxito de sacar un sencillo mientras alguien se gana un Grammy. Entonces, todo es relativo. Y poder trabajar con Gustavo, que fue inesperado.​Trabajar con SantaolallaCuando se presentó ante Santaolalla, luego de que un amigo fue el mediador para mostrarle su música, Sofía llegó \"como con 20 demos\". De ahí, el productor escogió 7, y \"me mandó en la búsqueda de otras tres canciones: Solo quiero quererte, Rota y Más alto, que la compuse con él\".\"Fue un año y medio de producción, fue un proceso largo, pero siempre estuvo muy abierto a mis ideas\", rememora la también graduada en la carrera de cine.Ideas que llegaron a buen puerto gracias a la apertura de ambos para conversar. Por ejemplo, con la canción La loca, la cantante consideró darle una orientación más comercial, pero Gustavo la aterrizó: \"Me dijo 'La canción quiere ser de esta forma y no podemos hacerla algo que no es'. Me enseñó que tienes que servir a la canción, no servirte a ti como artista\".Otra enseñanza del laureado artista, que lo mismo trabaja con el colombiano Juanes que en el soundtrack de la serieThe last of us, fue aprender a soltar.\"Con mi arte puedo llegar a ser un poco controladora, porque creo que tengo la visión muy clara, pero tienes que rodearte de gente más talentosa que tú y confiar\".Tras la salida del disco, que se mantiene con más de 28 mil oyentes mensuales en Spotify, el trabajo no se detiene: ahora toca preparar un show en vivo impregnado de La reina del cañón. \"El orden de las canciones en el disco no es el orden de tocar en vivo, entonces ha sido interesante experimentar con las canciones\".Karina Sofía cierra la charla con MILENIO esperanzada ante el futuro, donde promete que su creatividad se mantendrá efervescente y sincera: \"Es bueno evolucionar como artista, tener esa libertad de reinventarte. En el disco me arriesgue a fusionar sonidos y escribir directamente del corazón. No tengo interés en escribir canciones con máscaras para ser comerciales o populares\".hc",

They know the constant struggle to get this album, which has been my dream, \"says Zoom, outlining a big smile. The queen of the Cañón their 11 themes, the Queen of the Cañónse shows eclectic with her fusion of folklore, rock, pop and regional- to which she clarifies did not adopt by tendency, but for genuine interest -. And synthesizes emotions that came out \"directly from the heart\" of its creator, who began to compose during the Covid-19 Pandemia. \"I see it as a representation of who I am as a person and artist. Sonically reflects it. Also the visual world with the videos. From the beginning I had the idea of ​​making a concept disc with a story, a line, an arc. And it was achieved.\" Karina, who was nominated in the last edition of the Awards within the female artist category of the year, does not hesitate: \"Empowerment.\" \"I would like people, when I listen to the album, if you are looking for empowerment, stand out, heal something or any kind of duel, help you.\" And in the short term he already works on something: \"I am a fan of the comics, then we are doing one and the idea is to bring the visual comic to the stage.\" So, everything is relative. And being able to work with Gustavo, who was unexpected. Working with Santaolalduando appeared against Santaolalla, after a friend was the mediator to show him his music, Sofia arrived \"as with 20 demos.\" From there, the producer chose 7, and \"sent me in the search for three other songs: I just want to love you, broken and taller, that I composed it with him.\" For example, with the song La Loca, the singer considered giving her a more commercial orientation, but Gustav Release. \"With my art I can become a bit controlling, because I think I have the vision very clear, but you have to surround yourself with people more talented than you and trust. \"The order of the songs on the album is not the order to play live, so it has been interesting to experiment with the songs.\" Karina Sofia closes the talk with a hopeful millennium before the future, where she promises that her creativity will remain effervescent and sincere: \"It is good to evolve as an artist, to have that freedom to reinvent you. In the album To be commercial or popular \".hc",

      "description": "Carlos Vela, el genio rebelde del futbol mexicano, cuelga los botines a los 36 años tras una carrera marcada por goles, títulos y una visión distinta del juego. Ídolo en el LAFC, figura internacional y campeón juvenil, su historia comenzó en Chivas… pero nunca terminó ahí.Originario de Cancún y siguiendo los pasos de su hermano Alejandro, el menor de la familia Vela comenzó a jugar futbol en 1998 en las playas del Caribe mexicano, donde desde niño deslumbraba con su talento.Fue formado en el club local Ko'Cha'Wolis, una institución modesta pero clave en su desarrollo. En 2021, el propio Vela ganó una demanda contra dicho club, que reclamaba derechos de formación, luego de que se demostrara que no cumplía con los requisitos establecidos por la FIFA.No tardó en ser detectado por visores del Rebaño Sagrado, que lo integraron primero a una filial rojiblanca y luego, en 2002, a las fuerzas básicas del Guadalajara.Allí coincidió con figuras y jugadores como Javier “Chicharito” Hernández, José Meléndez, Sergio Arias, Omar Esparza, Patricio Araujo, Edgar Mejía y Arturo Ledesma, actual capitán y campeón de la Liga de Expansión con Leones Negros. Sin embargo, Vela nunca debutó con el primer equipo de Chivas.Ha sido, un honor y un privilegio compartir mi carrera con todos ustedes.“Gracias Carlos” pic.twitter.com/qbW4EUskdu— carlos vela (@11carlosV) May 27, 2025\n\n\nEl atacante se catapultó al escaparate mundial tras conquistar la Copa Mundial Sub-17 de Perú 2005 con la selección mexicana, donde también se coronó campeón de goleo. Ese mismo año, fue campeón de Tercera División con Chivas en el Clausura 2005. Su rendimiento llamó la atención del Arsenal de Inglaterra, que lo fichó a los 16 años.La transferencia incluyó una cláusula clave:“Si el Arsenal decidiera vender a Carlos, la primera opción en cualquier parte del mundo es de Chivas”, explicó en su momento Néstor de la Torre, entonces directivo del club tapatío. Pese a ello, Vela jamás volvió a vestir la camiseta rojiblanca.Su carrera prosiguió por equipos de España, Inglaterra y Estados Unidos, donde siempre dejó muestras de su clase. Hoy, se despide como uno de los talentos más singulares que ha dado el futbol mexicano.MAOJ",

      "title": "On Youm-i-Takbeer, leadership notes country’s nuclear arms ensured its sovereignty amid India hostility",
      "description": "President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday hailed Pakistan’s nuclear capability as ensuring the country’s sovereignty, especially during the recent hostilities with India. With a public holiday, the nation is celebrating Youm-i-Takbeer to mark the historic day of May 28, 1998 when Pakistan joined the ranks of nuclear powers after atomic tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan. Pakistan became the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal. PM Shehbaz emphasised that Youm-i-Takbeer was more than a celebration and was a solemn reminder of Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty, according to his statement carried by the Associated Press of Pakistan . He linked this year’s commemoration with what he described as Pakistan’s recent success in defending itself from “an unjustified war imposed by India”. Appreciating the nation’s spirit during the confrontation, the premier said, “The joys of Youm-i-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.” President Zardari also observed: “In today’s evolving regional security situation, our nuclear capability continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees our peace and ensures that no one can undermine our sovereignty and national security.” In a statement , he highlighted that the 1998 achievement was not “merely a demonstration of our technological advancement — it was a calculated decision to ensure peace through strength, to maintain the strategic balance in South Asia, and to protect our nation against any external aggression”. PM Shehbaz, in a post on X, said: “We thank Allah Almighty for His countless blessings and for granting us yet another glorious victory in the face of recent Indian aggression.” “We commend our valiant armed forces for their unwavering resolve and determination to defend the nation’s frontiers against all external and internal threats. “In the same spirit of unity and resolve, we pledge to build Pakistan into a strong economic power that would become the envy of the world,” the premier vowed. He hailed his brother and then-PM Nawaz Sharif for making “Pakistan’s defence invincible with his bold and courageous decision in 1998 to go ahead with a peaceful nuclear test in the face of strong opposition from many powerful countries”. He also paid tribute to former president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for his “visionary leadership”, as well as “brilliant scientists and engineers who turned the vision and aspirations of the entire nation into reality”. In his special statement on the occasion, PM Shehbaz urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-i-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation. Thanking patriotic Pakistanis, he said, “I salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith.” Reflecting on the historic nuclear tests conducted during Nawaz’s tenure, Shehbaz noted that the decision to respond with six nuclear tests, compared to India’s five, was a demonstration of “iron resolve” in the face of global pressure and sanctions. “Mr Nawaz Sharif represented the aspirations and national interests of the entire nation … and made our geographical borders impregnable forever,” the premier stressed. The premier also paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, including Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. He invoked the leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and said, “National history is a witness that the people and political leadership of Pakistan have always made the impossible possible.” Twenty-seven years ago, a team of Pakistani scientists led by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr Samar Mubarakmand carried out nuclear tests in the Raskoh Hills in Chagai, upon Nawaz’s decision in response to Indian nuclear tests. In his message on the occasion, President Zardari noted that Pakistan “demonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace” in the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression. “Our calibrated response, under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, was measured and effective, which forced the enemy to cease its hostile actions.” He reaffirmed that Pakistan did not seek conflict and was committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. “This day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country,” the president said. President Zardari also paid a rich tribute to Pakistani scientists, engineers, as civil and military leadership. He also appreciated Bhutto for laying the foundation of the nuclear programme and ex-premier Benazir Bhutto’s role in further strengthening it. Armed forces renew pledge to remain vigilant, united The armed forces of Pakistan, along with the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the services chiefs, extended heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the 27th anniversary of Youm-i-Takbeer. According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Youm-i-Takbeer commemorated the momentous occasion in 1998 when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power, restoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence. The statement said this historic achievement epitomises the nation’s resolve, unity, and unwavering pursuit of a dignified and peaceful existence. “Pakistan’s strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people. The commemoration of Youm-e-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan’s defence unassailable,” it added. “Let this day renew our collective pledge to remain vigilant, united, and resolute in our commitment to the security, progress, and prosperity of our beloved homeland.”",

      "title": "Consumers to bear burden as K-Electric allowed to build recovery losses into tariff",
      "description": "ISLAMABAD: In a major policy departure, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday approved K-Electric’s request to incorporate unrecovered bills into its consumer tariff — starting with a recovery shortfall of 6.75 per cent in 2023-24, gradually declining to 3.5pc by 2029-30. Nepra set K-Electric’s base tariff at Rs40 per unit for the fiscal year 2023-24, which is almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector power distribution companies (Discos). The delta between the Discos’ average and K-Electric’s tariff is transferred to the taxpayers through the federal budget in the form of tariff differential subsidy. In a detailed determination, the regulator changed K-Electric’s tariff mechanism based on 100pc recovery of bills and instead allowed recovery losses in the tariff, starting from 6.75pc in FY24 and gradually declining to 3.5pc by F30. Nepra sets utility’s base rate at Rs40 per unit, 40pc higher than national average tariff Interestingly, the Discos’ tariff is still based on a 100pc recovery of bills. The judgement on K-Electric indicated that a similar charge may be coming up for Discos’ tariff in the shape of higher costs to honest consumers. “To ensure sufficient liquidity in the power market and to align the collection targets with current market realities, the authority has decided to allow recovery loss to K-Electric,” Nepra said, directing K-Electric to ensure collection of 93.35pc of FY24 billing, 93.6pc in FY25, 94.4pc in FY26, 95.19pc in FY27, 95.7pc in FY28, 96.10pc in FY29, and 96.5pc in FY30. The loss recovery allowance, starting at 93.25pc, was opposed by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division). Although it supported the loss recovery allowance through tariff, apparently to claim similar dispensation for government-owned Discos, it said a lower recovery ratio should be allowed, starting with 96.7pc, and an increase in commercial losses should be benchmarked against efficient Discos to arrive at reasonable targets. Nepra set the total average tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for FY24, which included a power purchase cost of Rs31.96, transmission cost of Rs2.86, distribution cost of Rs3.31, and supply margin of Rs2.28, with a negative prior-year adjustment of 44 paise per unit to ensure total revenue requirement of Rs606 billion. Interestingly, the above tariff is based on almost half of the power supply from the national grid; otherwise, K-Electric’s average base rate would have been much higher. This determination covers a total power dispatch of 17,768 gigawatt-hours (GWh) — 48pc sourced from the national grid, 42pc from K-Electric’s own generation, and 9.9pc from private suppliers. K-Electric’s total revenue requirement determined by Nepra at Rs606.92bn for FY24 included a supply margin Rs34.68bn, operations and maintenance (O&M) allowance at Rs5.91bn, negative working capital adjustment of Rs1.244bn, recovery loss of Rs36.25bn, gross margin of Rs40.92bn, and net margin of Rs34.68bn after a negative prior-year adjustment of Rs6.69bn. The power regulator noted that K-Electric’s previous multi-year tariff (MYT) for 2017-23 did not allow any provision on account of recovery loss. Instead, actual write-offs were allowed subject to prescribed criteria. Considering that FY24 had already lapsed and FY25 was almost 10 months gone, K-Electric’s actual recovery for FY24 remained at 91.5pc, whereas FY25 was expected to close at 90.5pc, it said. The financial impact of these under-recoveries was around Rs40bn and Rs57bn, respectively. “The authority noted that return allowed to K-Electric for its distribution function is around Rs21.6bn, meaning thereby that effectively K-Electric would be incurring losses for the first two years of MYT, if no recovery loss is allowed to K-Electric. This may compromise the financial viability of the company, which is neither in the interest of the consumers nor power system as whole,” Nepra said. The regulator said that Discos were not allowed any recovery loss, but the federal government had the power to levy surcharges to offset the inefficiencies of Discos arising from high losses and under-recoveries. However, no such option is available for K-Electric, as it can only charge the regulated tariff. It said the National Electricity Policy 2021 empowered Nepra to revisit the target for collections and align with the current market realities through “efficient tariff structures for sufficient liquidity in the power market” as “international precedents also suggest that 100pc billing recovery is generally not mandated”. Solar projects In a separate development, Nepra approved bidding results of K-Electric’s two solar-powered plants with a combined capacity of 150 megawatts, promising the lowest-ever rates in Pakistan. Under the determination, Master Textile Mills Limited has been declared the lowest bidder at the lowest offered tariff of Rs11.6508 (4.0363 US cents) per kilowatt-hour for the 50MW Winder project, and Rs11.21 (3.8826 US cents) per kWh for the 100MW Bela project. The two projects are estimated to bring savings, both in terms of cost and forex outflow, in both national and K-Electric’s grids, by displacing the existing expensive generation, Nepra said. It added that energy cost savings due to fuel displacement were estimated at Rs2.3bn annually, amounting to a total of Rs57.8bn over the life of the projects. Additionally, the projects are estimated to generate annual foreign exchange savings of $17.01 million, totalling $425.2m in savings over their lifespan. Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "description": "SpaceX’s Starship rocket roared into space from Texas on Tuesday but spun out of control about halfway through its flight without achieving some of its most important testing goals, bringing fresh engineering hurdles to CEO Elon Musk’s increasingly turbulent Mars rocket programme. The 400-foot tall (122 metre) Starship rocket system, the core of Musk’s goal of sending humans to Mars, lifted off from SpaceX’s Starbase, Texas, launch site, flying beyond the point of two previous explosive attempts earlier this year that sent debris streaking over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to divert course. For the latest launch, the ninth full test mission of Starship since the first attempt in April 2023, the upper-stage cruise vessel was lofted to space atop a previously flown booster — a first such demonstration of the booster’s reusability. People wait to watch SpaceX’s next-generation Starship spacecraft launch on its ninth test, at South Padre Island, Texas, US, May 27, 2025.— Reuters But SpaceX lost contact with the 232-foot lower-stage booster during its descent before it plunged into the sea, rather than making the controlled splashdown the company had planned. Starship, meanwhile, continued into suborbital space but began to spin uncontrollably roughly 30 minutes into the mission. The errant spiraling came after SpaceX cancelled a plan to deploy eight mock Starlink satellites into space — the rocket’s “Pez” candy dispenser-like mechanism failed to work as designed. “Not looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,” SpaceX broadcaster Dan Huot said on a company livestream. Musk was scheduled to deliver an update on his space exploration ambitions in a speech from Starbase following the test flight, billed as a livestream presentation about “The Road to Making Life Multiplanetary.” Hours later, he had yet to give the speech and there was no sign that he intended to do so. In a post on X, Musk touted Starship’s scheduled shutdown of an engine in space, a step previous test flights achieved last year. He said a leak on Starship’s primary fuel tank led to its loss of control. “Lot of good data to review,” he said. “Launch cadence for next three flights will be faster, at approximately one every three to four weeks.” SpaceX has said the Starship models that have flown this year bear significant design upgrades from previous prototypes, as thousands of company employees work to build a multi-purpose rocket capable of putting massive batches of satellites in space, carrying humans back to the moon and ultimately ferrying astronauts to Mars. Risk-tolerant The recent setbacks indicate SpaceX is struggling to overcome a complicated chapter of Starship’s multibillion-dollar development. But the company’s engineering culture, widely considered more risk-tolerant than many of the aerospace industry’s more established players, is built on a flight-testing strategy that pushes spacecraft to the point of failure, then fine-tunes improvements through frequent repetition. Starship’s planned trajectory for Tuesday included a nearly full orbit around Earth for a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean to test new designs of its heat shield tiles and revised flaps for steering its blazing re-entry and descent through Earth’s atmosphere. But its early demise, appearing as a fireball streaking eastward through the night sky over southern Africa, puts another pause in Musk’s speedy development goals for a rocket bound to play a central role in the US space programme. NASA plans to use the rocket to land humans on the moon in 2027, though that moon programme faces turmoil amid Musk’s Mars-focused influence over US President Donald Trump’s administration. Mishap probe Federal regulators had granted SpaceX a licence for Starship’s latest flight attempt four days ago, capping a mishap investigation that had grounded Starship for nearly two months. The last two test flights — in January and March — were cut short moments after liftoff as the vehicles blew to pieces on ascent, raining debris over parts of the Caribbean and disrupting scores of commercial airline flights in the region. The Federal Aviation Administration expanded debris hazard zones around the ascent path for Tuesday’s launch. The previous back-to-back failures occurred in early test-flight phases that SpaceX had easily achieved before, in a striking setback to a program that Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the rocket company in 2002, had sought to accelerate this year. Musk, the world’s wealthiest individual and a key supporter of US President Donald Trump, was especially eager for a success after vowing in recent days to refocus his attention on his various business ventures, including SpaceX, following a tumultuous foray into national politics and his attempts at cutting government bureaucracy. Closer to home, Musk also sees Starship as eventually replacing the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as the workhorse in the company’s commercial launch business, which already lofts most of the world’s satellites and other payloads to low-Earth orbit.",

      "title": "Audit exposes Rs245.5m arms ‘disappearance’ from Punjab police stores",
      "description": "LAHORE: The audit report for 2023-24 of the Punjab Home Department reveals the ‘disappearance’ of arms and ammunition worth millions of rupees from the institutions operating under the department’s oversight. The report presented to the Punjab Assembly details the theft, disappearance and non-recovery of arms from police stores in 12 districts. The total value of the missing equipment is reported to exceed Rs245.5 million, none of which has been recovered to date. As per the report, weapons worth over Rs83.4m went ‘missing’ from the Muzaffargarh DPO office between 2021 and 2023; arms and bullets valued at over Rs47.1m are unaccounted for in the DIG Operations Lahore office; weapons worth more than Rs46.8m missing from the Police Office Lahore have not been recovered. Likewise, rifles and ammunition exceeding Rs7.4m value have disappeared from the CPO Multan’s office; the record of rifles issued to various officers in 2009 is missing from the Central Jail Lahore; weapons and equipment valued at Rs5.614m are missing from the DPO Sialkot office; arms worth Rs4.3m are missing from the DPO Sahiwal office; weapons and equipment exceeding Rs3.8m have disappeared from the DPO Okara office. Home dept orders probe; house echoes with criticism of CCD, proposed Goonda Act Arms worth Rs3.5m are missing from DPO Gujrat office; weapons and ammunition valued at over Rs2.6m have disappeared from the DPO Faisalabad office. In response to the alarming findings, Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal has ordered an inquiry into the missing weapons’ report. An inquiry committee has been formed, headed by the Additional IG Special Branch, with the Director-General Monitoring and Additional Secretary Judicial (Home) as members, says a spokesperson for the department. The committee has been tasked with submitting a report within 10 days. It will also require responses regarding the irregularities detailed in the audit report. The home department clarifies that it does not directly store weapons; rather, they are held by law enforcement agencies, who are responsible and accountable for the use of arms. Action will be taken against those found responsible upon receipt of the inquiry report, the spokesperson says quoting the home secretary. Meanwhile, a general debate on law and order in the Punjab Assembly saw strong criticism from Leader of Opposition Ahmad Khan Bhachar regarding the absence of home department officials from the gallery. “I am dismayed to see that no representative from the department was present.” Following Bhachar’s strong objections, Panel of Chairperson Samiullah Khan expressed his displeasure, emphasising that the presence of senior home department officials is mandatory during discussions on law and order. He announced that a letter of disapproval would be sent to the home department regarding their absence. Despite their absence, the opposition chose not to boycott the session, vowing to deliver speeches that would cause “annoyance to the government”. Bhachar accused the government of failing completely to establish law and order in the province. He criticised the creation of a crime control department (CCD) that empowered 4,000 individuals despite the existence of a police force of 250,000. Contradicting government claims of reduced crime, he cited alarming statistics for Lahore: 324 incidents on one day and 370 on another. He also recounted instances of police high-handedness, including stopping MPAs outside Adiala Jail, continued FIRs against them, and leaving them stranded after release. He labeled the Punjab Police as “savage beasts” serving only the “elite class.” Bhachar condemned the government’s proposed “ Goonda Act ,” calling it a “black law” from the 1930s British era, designed to empower district intelligence committees and officers to intrude into people’s homes and expose them to sensitive agencies. Opposition MPA Sheikh Imtiaz regretted that the standing committee chairmen would give protocol to the police officers summoned by the committee in different cases. He claimed that Punjab University students say that most of the ice in the varsity was sold by policemen. Ahsan Raza, another PTI MPA, criticised the creation of CCD saying it is a system parallel to the police and leading to clash with the police. Treasury MPA Rana Arshad defended the creation of CCD as a step to improve protection of the people. Malik Arshad, another PML-N MPA, sought expansion of CCD to the whole province. Opposition’s Junaid Sahi said CCD could become only a unit of the home department and not a full department. He demanded abolition of the 250,000-strong police department if 4,000 CCD officials could maintain order in the province. Parliamentary secretary Khalid Ranjha wondered that the opposition cried hoarse on the law and order issue and when a department like CCD is established to improve the situation, it is criticised before giving it time to show performance. He asked why the opposition feared that the Goonda Act was being introduced for them. Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "description": "• Finance minister vows to shift tax burden away from salaried class, other documented sectors • Meets commercial banks, regulators, industry bodies to gather input for budget • Stakeholders agree incentives must make digital payments more appealing than cash • Ceramic tile manufacturers say import dependence cut from 74pc to 4pc • New digital financing model being developed to support small-scale farmers ISLAMABAD: As part of pre-budget consultations with stakeholders, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and documented sector to others through digitisation, and hinted at major steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions. A Ministry of Finance team, led by the minister, had a series of meetings with commercial banks, development financial institutions, regulators and industrial representatives, including ceramics manufacturers and steel producers, to discuss policy measures for inclusion in the next year’s federal budget . Some of the proposals finalised during these meetings are believed to be strategic in nature to capture most of the undocumented economy through digitisation, including additional tax measures on cash transactions, incentives on digital payments and outrightly blocking cash payments in certain critical sectors to be identified by the Federal Board of Revenue with the support of Karandaaz, the Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited and the banking sector. One of the meetings on accelerating Pakistan’s transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy finalised a host of measures for inclusion in the federal budget to expand access to digital financial services, encourage the use of digital transactions, and reduce reliance on cash in everyday economic activity. The meeting decided to fine-tune measures for the budget given the fact that digital payment options were widely available and accessible across various sectors, including retail, services and public sector transactions. The participants supported steps that would encourage broad-based interoperability, leveraging Raast instant payments system in particular, leading to improved consumer choice in using digital payments platforms, according to a statement. The meeting agreed that creating a more level playing field between cash and digital transactions was essential, and that incentive structures should be rebalanced to make digital payments more attractive and cost-effective for both consumers and businesses. The importance of imp­r­oving cost structures related to digital transaction infrastructure, including merchant acquisition and service provision, was taken as a priority to enable wider outreach, especially for small merchants and underserved communities. The finance minister believed that moving towards a cashless economy was not simply a policy aspiration, but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness and inclusive growth. “Digitalisation is the foundation of a modern financial system. We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payments environment that is inclusive, interoperable, and focused on ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,” he said. Engagements with industry In a meeting with a delegation of the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association (APCTMA) and Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSA), Mr Aurangzeb said the government was committed to shifting the tax burden away from the already compliant formal sector and the salaried class towards segments of the economy that have so far remained undocumented or under-taxed. The prime minister is personally leading high-level meetings to drive forward reforms that enhance transparency, documentation and economic equity across all, he said, adding that broadening the tax base is essential to achieving fiscal balance and promoting fairness in the economy. The ceramic tiles manufacturers reported the manufacturing capacity at about 560,000 square metres per day, backed by over Rs100 billion in investments, nearly 60 per cent of which is foreign direct investment from China. They said the industry has reduced import dependency from 74pc to just 4pc and now relies almost entirely on local raw materials and labour. The minister also assured the delegation that reforms in the energy sector were a top policy priority and envisaged a series of measures aimed at improving affordability, ensuring reliability, and moving towards a more efficient and targeted energy pricing structure. He also pledged to simplify regulatory procedures, reduce compliance burden, and create a stable and predictable policy environment to attract further investment. Credit access for small farmers The finance minister also chaired a meeting of the Task Force on National Initiative to Unlock Un-Collateralised Credit for Small Farmers Through Tech-Driven Solutions. He reviewed the recommendations for the National Subsistence Farmers Support Initiative, aimed at unlocking uncollateralised financing for small-scale farmers through innovative, technology-based solutions and enhanced access to credit. The proposed scheme would employ an end-to-end digital process to ensure transparency, efficiency, and a seamless customer experience. Designed as a federal programme with nationwide coverage, the initiative aims to align provincial and national efforts to boost agricultural productivity, enhance food security, and contribute meaningfully to GDP growth through inclusive agri-development. A revised scorecard was presented by the task force with a greater emphasis on agronomic factors — raising the weightage of agronomy from 40pc to 60pc — while maintaining a 40pc weight on financial indicators, thereby rebalancing priorities to better reflect the realities of smallholder farming. The prototype scheme, developed by the Ministry of Finance’s Task Force on Access to Finance, calls for a multi-bank and microfinance institution (MFI) delivery model implemented through a unified methodology, ensuring wide outreach and operational standardisation across financial institutions. It was decided to make the entire process time-bound and action-oriented to achieve lasting impact and then replicate a parallel, tech-supported model for the dairy and livestock segment, as most smallholder farmers maintain herds but faced difficulties in securing financing for livestock acquisition, maintenance, and dairy product marketing. The delegation of Large Steel Producers raised critical challenges facing the steel industry, including high energy costs, regulatory inconsistencies, and the need for a stable policy environment to ensure long-term investment and growth. They also highlighted the impact of taxation policies on formal businesses and sought government support to level the playing field. The finance minister promised to resolve these challenges and reiterated that every sector must play its role in stabilising and growing the economy. “We cannot allow the burden to fall solely on the formal sector and the salaried class,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the government was pursuing a broad-based strategy to expand the tax base, reduce reliance on over-taxed segments and bring the undocumented economy into the fold.

      "description": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration has ordered a halt to new student visa interviews as it considers requiring foreign students to undergo social media vetting as part of their application to study in the United States, Politico reported on Tuesday, citing a diplomatic cable. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt. She  had threatened last month to block international students at the school  unless it turned over records on visa holders’  “illegal and violent activities.” But a judge quickly suspended the move after the university sued to “stop the government’s arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and unconstitutional action.” There will be an injunction hearing on Thursday, a court filing showed. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement that the attempted foreign students ban “imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities  throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.” In addition to undermining the independence of storied US universities — which attract top students from around the world and produce much of the country’s lucrative scientific research — Trump has sought to dismantle the government’s traditional soft power tools, including humanitarian aid and the Voice of America radio network. Meanwhile, the US government intends to cancel all remaining financial contracts with Harvard, a senior official said on Tuesday, in President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to force the prestigious university to submit to unprecedented oversight. The administration “will send a letter to federal agencies today asking them to identify any contracts with Harvard, and whether they can be canceled or redirected elsewhere,” the official said. The ending of contracts — estimated by US media to be worth $100 million — would mark the severance of business ties between the government and an institution that is both the country’s oldest university and a global research powerhouse. Amid a broad push to amass power in the White House, Trump has singled out Harvard for particularly fierce punishment. His administration accuses the Cambridge, Massachusetts university of permitting anti-Semitism and pervasive liberal bias. Harvard has rejected orders to allow a series of extraordinary measures, including an audit of political leanings on campus and a ban on students deemed to be  “hostile to the American values.” In the last few weeks, the elite educational bastion has seen billions of dollars in federal grants frozen and an attempt — paused last Friday by a court ruling — to end its ability to host foreign students. The university is fighting back, arguing that the Trump attacks are unconstitutional and would cripple its ability to function. On Monday, Trump vowed he would prevail in the increasingly public struggle. In a social media post he claimed that foreign students at Harvard included  “radicalised lunatics, troublemakers.” Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

This is the second time in a week that a storm of such intensity wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, damaging crops, properties, and other  infrastructure. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others  injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains had battered many areas in Islamabad, Punjab and KP on Saturday. On Tuesday, two people were killed and around 20 injured after a thunderstorm swept through various parts of Punjab. The storm, accompanied by heavy rainfall, strong winds, and hail, caused widespread destruction. According to Rescue 1122, a passenger van overturned due to rain and dust storm on Ghazi-Lawrencepur Road near Ghazi Interchange in Attock, which resulted in the death of one passenger and left five others injured. Separately, four children aged between nine and 12 years were injured when the wall of their house collapsed during the windstorm in Rehmo village of Attock district.  Also, a 25-year-old woman received multiple injuries when the roof of her house collapsed in the same area. An 11-year-old girl was critically injured when the wall of her house in Saghirabad area of Attock collapsed. According to the Rescue 1122’s provincial headquarters, a man was killed after lightning struck him in Mianwali’s Kalabagh. The district experienced multiple emergencies including a wall collapse that left one person injured at the Makkharwal police station and a falling solar panel that inju­red another resident. In Gujran­wala, a young girl fell from roof due to powerful gusts. In Taunsa Sharif, a woman was injured when the wall of her house collapsed. Three people, including two children, were inj­ured in Rawalpindi as gusty winds battered the garrison city in the afternoon. According to the PDMA, these ext­r­eme conditions are likely to persist through May 31, with upper and central Punjab districts inc­luding Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, facing the highest risk. Two killed in KP In Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, two people lost their lives and another 10 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents. Rains lashed many areas of the province, leaving several people injured. A child died while four others were injured in a roof collapse incident in Swabi. Another person died and three members of the same family were injured in a lightning strike in Shangla district. In the Mattani area of the provincial capital, three persons were injured when the roof of their house collapsed, while another one was injured in another rain-related incident in the Badershi area of Nowshera district. The upper parts of the Hazara division on Tuesday received heavy downpour and snowfall, blocking the Karakoram Highway to all sorts of traffic at two locations in the Lower Kohistan. “The floodwater carrying heavy rocks and stones from nearby mountains blocked the Karakoram Highway at two points in our district,” Mohammad Duraj, an official from Rescue 1122, Lower Kohistan, told reporters. Babusar Top, the highest point in the Kaghan Valley, received heavy snowfall, significantly dropping temperatures across the district. KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in a statement issued here said that the spell will continue till May 30. It said the rain caused widespread damage to the crops. PDMA said wheat, vegetables and fruit crops were badly damaged in Mardan and its surrounding areas due to the hailstorm. Besides, rains also disrupted the power supply across the province as 113 of Peshawar Electric Supply Company tripped due to rain and thunderstorm. Three killed in AJK In Kashmir, three women lost their lives and a man went missing while several properties were damaged after a “cloudburst-induced flood” wreaked havoc in a suburban area of Muzaffarabad on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. Saeed Qureshi, a senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn that the “cloudburst” triggered a flood in a water channel in Balgran village, located around 35 kilometres from Muzaffarabad on the right bank of the Neelum River, at about 4pm. Among the victims were Zaiwar Jan, 75, and her daughter Shireen Bibi, 35, who died when the raging current swept into their house and filled it with mud. Station House Officer (SHO) of Panjgran Iftikhar Awan, who spoke to Dawn from the affected village, said the mother’s body was recovered immediately, while the daughter’s body was later pulled from the debris. In another severely affected house nearby, rescuers found 35-year-old Gori Bibi critically injured and unconscious. She was rushed to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Patikka, where she succumbed to her injuries later in the evening. Gori Bibi’s father, 65-year-old Jalal Deen, was reported missing. “We have been trying to locate him, but to no avail,” said SHO Awan. Videos shared by residents showed muddy water gushing through the ground floor of the village’s main mosque, which was built almost along the course of the water channel, where water flow is usually minimal. According to SHO Awan, the flood, which lasted for about half an hour, completely destroyed the mosque. Mr Qureshi from the SDMA said initial assessments indicated partial damage to 20–25 houses and the mosque. However, SHO Awan feared that the figure could be higher. “At the moment, our priority is to assess the human losses. Material damages will be evaluated in daylight on Wednesday,” he said. Separately, in Islamabad, the district administration decided to move billboards out of the city after a hoarding fixed at the National Press Club collapsed due to a windstorm that had also uprooted several trees.

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: Aleema Khan, sister of incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, on Tues­day proposed a “give-and-take formula” for his re­lease, alleging that “unseen forces” were pr­e­ssuring judges and inf­luencing legal proceedings. Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Aleema claimed that court cases involving her brother were being manipulated, and that petitions were being removed from cause lists under pressure. “I want to tell the unseen forces that I am ready to negotiate,” she said. “They should tell us what Imran has done to them. Instead of fearing Imran and his sisters, they should speak to me directly.” She further alleged that these hidden elements were exerting undue influence on judges and parliamentarians, calling for transparency and direct dialogue. Later, she attempted to meet her brother at Adiala Jail but was denied access, though her two other sisters and several lawyers were granted a meeting. In a separate media talk in the neighbouring garrison city, Aleema Khan questioned Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chair­man Barrister Gohar Ali Khan over his repeated claims that Imran Khan would be released before Eidul Azha, which will fall on June 7. “If he has good news, he should share it with party workers,” she said. She said the PTI was preparing for massive nationwide protests, while clarifying that Imran Khan had no plans to summon workers to Islamabad because he was aware that “snipers are stationed in the capital to target them”. She stressed that Mr Khan had clearly said he could spend the rest of his life in jail if it was in the country’s best interest. Gandapur criticises federal govt Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Min­ister Ali Amin Gand­apur, standing alongside her, criticised the federal government and judiciary, blaming the 26th Amend­ment for the current political instability. He claimed that the amendment had worsened the situation and vowed to repeal it once his party returned to power. Mr Gandapur reiterated that the Feb 8 general elections were rigged and that PTI’s mandate was ‘stolen’. “There is no case against Imran Khan, and there is no justification for keeping him behind bars,” he said.

      "description": "KARACHI: Two sisters were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors said on Tuesday. Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn that both the girls, aged 15 and 8, were brought to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) by their maternal and paternal uncles at 5:30pm. She said that the girls were examined at the health facility and “findings are strongly suggestive of sexual violence”. Evidentiary samples had been collected for serology and DNA profiling and cross matching, she said, adding that both sisters bore marks of “severe physical violence”. The condition of the eight-year-old was serious, she said. Dr Summaiya said the relatives had on May 25 brought the girls to a government hospital in New Karachi with complaint of sexual harassment and torture. Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that their father had died four years ago and their mother had married another man and was living with him with her four children. He said that a few days ago the girls’ mother had informed the Khwaja Ajmer Nagri police that her daughters were “maltreated by an intruder”. However, the girls’ uncles had informed hospital officials on Tuesday that they were beaten by their stepfather. He said that the police were investigating the case.

      "description": "DHAKA: Bangladesh’s top court on Tuesday overturned a conviction against a key leader of the country’s main religious party, who had been on death row since being sentenced under the regime ousted last year. A.T.M. Azharul Islam, from the Jamaat-i-Islami party, and who has been in custody since 2012, was acquitted of crimes against humanity by the Supreme Court, which ordered his release. Azharul Islam, who was born in 1952, was among six senior political leaders convicted during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year-long autocratic rule as prime minister ended in August 2024 when a student-led revolt forced her to flee. Political parties, including Jamaat-i-Islami, are readying for hugely anticipated elections which the interim government has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest. Islam’s lawyer Shishir Monir said he was “fortunate” because the five other senior political leaders who had been convicted — four from Jamaat-i-Islami, and another from the key Bangladesh National Party (BNP) — had already been hanged. “He got justice because he is alive”, Monir told reporters. “The appellate division failed to review the evidence in other cases for crimes against humanity.” Azharul Islam had been sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during the 1971 military operation. Hasina banned Jamaat-i-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders. Azharul Islam appealed in 2015, but the court upheld the verdict in 2019, and he filed a review petition in 2020. Hasina, 77, fled to India last year as crowds stormed her palace, and she remains there in exile. Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "description": "CAIRO: Thousands of Palestinians stormed sites in southern Gaza where aid was being distributed on Tuesday by a foundation backed by the US and Israel, with desperation for food overcoming concern about biometric and other checks Israel said it would employ. By late afternoon, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to 462,000 meals, after an almost three-month-old Israeli blockade of the devastated enclave. In Rafah, which is under full Israeli army control, thousands of people, including women and children, some on foot or in donkey carts, flocked towards one of the distribution sites to receive food packages. Videos showed lines of people walking through a wired-off corridor and into a large open field where aid was stacked. Later, images shared on social media showed large parts of the fence torn down as people jostled their way onto the site. Private relief agency’s closeness to US and Israel’s endorsement of its distribution method have raised doubts about its neutrality Hamas denies accusation “The real cause of the delay and collapse in the aid distribution process is the tragic chaos caused by the mismanagement of the same company operating under the Israeli occupation administration in those buffer zones,” Ismail Al Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said. The Israel military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound and that control was re-established. A UN spokesperson called images of the incident “heartbreaking”. Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein wrote on X that 8,000 “food packages” were delivered to Pale­stinians on Tuesday, the first day of what he described as an American initiative. Screening procedures Although the aid was available on Monday, Palestinians appeared to have heeded warnings, including from Hamas, about biometric screening procedures employed at the foundation’s aid distribution sites. “As much as I want to go because I am hungry and my children are hungry, I am afraid,” said Abu Ahmed, 55. “I am so scared because they said the company belongs to Israel and is a mercenary, and also because the resistance (Hamas) said not to go,” he said in a message on WhatsApp. The Israeli military said four aid sites have been established in recent weeks across the enclave, and that two of them in the area of Rafah began operations on Tuesday and “are distributing food packages to thousands of families in Gaza Strip”. Israeli officials said one of the advantages of the new aid system is the opportunity to screen recipients to exclude anyone found to be connected with Hamas. Humanitarian groups briefed on GHF’s plans say anyone accessing aid will have to submit to facial recognition technology that many Palestinians fear will end up in Israeli hands to be used to track and potentially target them. Aid groups boycott GHF The United Nations and other international aid groups have boycotted the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which they say undermines the principle that aid should be distributed independently of the parties to a conflict, based on need. “Humanitarian assistance must not be politicised or militarised,” said Christian Cardon, chief spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross. United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters the UN has a sound plan “to get aid to a desperate population” and that Israel was allowing it to deliver relief, but with a lot of obstacles.

      "description": "• Ask SIC counsel if he is also representing PTI • ECP lawyer says declaration given by independents to join PTI not accepted by commission ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on Tuesday questioned the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) standing in the reserved seats case, noting that the original order had allocated seats to the PTI and not SIC. Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the 11-judge bench resumed the hearing on a set of petitions seeking to revisit the July 12, 2024, majority judgement. The issue about the locus standi of SIC cropped up when Justice Musarrat Hilali questioned the party’s counsel, Faisal Siddiqi, whether he was representing PTI or SIC. “Did PTI authorise the counsel to advance the arguments on their behalf too and did SIC know the counsel is also advocating for PTI since it may undermine their interest?” the judge observed. The counsel said he has a “right to support the majority judgement” and criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not implementing the apex court’s order after more than 11 months. The judgement had declared that 41 independents will file duly signed and notarised statements before the ECP within 15 days, explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party — PTI. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar wondered whether lawmakers had submitted any declaration indicating that they intended to join PTI after the majority judgment. If they had submitted the affidavits, then how the SIC can now stand before the court as its members resiled after submitting the declaration, the judge remarked. The ECP counsel said lawmakers did submit declarations, but the commission did not accept them. Then these lawmakers are still independent members, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed. The counsel replied that the ECP recognises them as SIC members. Justice Mazhar interjected, saying the Supreme Court declared these lawmakers independent, irrespective of whether the judgement had been implemented or not. Mr Siddiqi, who was representing the SIC, argued the objection on the locus standi didn’t apply to the respondents but to the petitioners. When the lawmakers decided to join PTI, their connection or relation with SIC was terminated, emphasised Justice Mazhar. He asked the counsel to explain his position, as he could not understand the argument. The lawyer accepted the judges’ remarks “for the time being” and suspended his argument. “So you agree that presently these members are independent,” Justice Mandokhail interjected again, adding that if the answer was affirmative, then the question was whether any one of them could even approach the court. Though conceded, the SIC lawyer said he wanted to argue on the maintainability of the review petitions first. “If these members are independent, then the role of SIC is still intact here,” Justice Mazhar remarked. Another bench member, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, asked about the “understanding” between PTI and questioned Mr Siddiqi whether the members he was representing belonged to PTI or SIC. Justice Hilali asked about the symbol on which Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the SIC chairman, contested the elections. She added that Mr Raza himself contested the February 2024 general election as an independent candidate. “Why did Hamid Raza not contest the election from the platform of SIC?” Justice Hilali asked and expressed her annoyance at Mr Siddiqi for agreeing to answer the questions but later avoiding them. “What was the philosophy behind SIC members contesting elections as independents?” she wondered. The counsel explained the lawmakers were not candidates of SIC, but rather independent and the majority judgement classified them as such. Later, they were candidates of the PTI and not independent. Mr Siddiqi said the court can grant three types of relief — set aside the majority judgement, the consequence of which would be that the Peshawar High Court judgement and the ECP’s decision will be revived. The second being substituting the majority judgement with the minority and the third being the majority judgement set aside and the appeals before PHC revived for re-hearing. Justice Khan observed that whatever record the majority judgment had relied upon was “not admissible” evidence as per the law. “No one knows which nomination papers — out of four — of these independent candidates were submitted by the ECP during the hearing.” He reminded the minority jud­gment, which he and Justice Nae­­em Akhtar Afghan had authored, did not rely on these records since they were not admitted as evidence. “Therefore, these were not part of the record of the case.” Justice Mandokhail remarked that it should be left to the court to consider whether the right of any party was being infringed upon or not. Later, the case was adjourned till Thursday. Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan on Tuesday told the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench hearing judges’ seniority dispute that the notification in which law secretary stated that judges would not require fresh oath after they were transferred to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) was meant to remove any ambiguity on oath. The explanation came after a member of the five-judge constitutional bench, Justice Shakeel Ahmed, asked whether the law secretary was “competent to clarify” in the notification that judges would not be required to take a fresh oath on their posting to the IHC. The AGP also explained that no question was raised on the judges’ transfer in the report of the chief justices and registrar of four high courts. He said the then chief justice of the IHC Aamir Farooq was completely independent in determining their seniority while deciding the representation of five IHC judges. At this, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was heading the constitutional bench, observed that the counsel representing the petitioner judges did not apprise the court about the representation moved by the judges the high court and its decision. The attorney general explained that the IHC judges had requested for determination of seniority upon taking the oath. Justice Aamir had complete independence in determining IHC judges’ seniority while deciding their representation, SC told Also, Justice Shakeel Ahmed observed that none of the counsel earlier mentioned the representation and subsequent decision by the then CJ of the high court. The AGP said Article 200 of the Constitution explained the method of transfer of the judges, whereas the power of veto to question any such transfer was with the judiciary and not with the executive. At the time of transfer, all the chief justices had expressed their willingness over the transfer, he added. But Justice Salahuddin Panwhar observed that an opinion of chief justice on the issue of seniority was never sought. During the hearing, the bench raised questions whether the authority of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) could be made ineffective by transferring judges on a permanent basis, also asking about any principles for judges’ transfer. Mr Awar reminded the court that Article 200 could not be made ineffective. Even when the 18th Amendment was made, Article 200 was not changed, he said. The AGP further said, in his opinion, setting a time for transferred judges was like adding new words to the Constitution. When Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan said that the minutes of JCP meeting held on Feb 10 should be provided, the AGP explained that two additional judges were appointed to the IHC in Jan 17 meeting of the commission whereas in the subsequent JCP meeting held on Feb 10, IHC CJ Aamir Farooq was elevated to the Supreme Court. Justice Afghan asked if acting IHC CJ Sardar Sarfaraz Dogar, too, was among those on the list to be considered for elevation by the JCP on Feb 10, the AGP replied in affirmative. The AGP requested the court to reject petitions of the PTI founder and others by declaring them as inadmissible.  On the other hand, the KP Advocate General said he supported the arguments advanced by lawyers on behalf of the petitioners. The AGP took the position that a judge was brought for a limited time only when the number of permanent judges of the high court was complete. Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "description": "LIVERPOOL: A 53-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs after a car ploughed into a crowd of Liverpool fans during a Premier League title parade, injuring more than 50, British police said. Eleven victims remained in hospital in a stable condition on Tuesday, police said, adding that they all appeared to be recovering well. British police believe the incident, in a packed Liverpool city centre on Monday, was isolated and not an act of terrorism. They said the driver of the grey Ford Galaxy people-carrier involved in the incident was believed to have followed an ambulance into a closed street when a road block was lifted to allow paramedics to attend to a suspected heart attack victim. Videos posted online showed the vehicle driving through the street crowded with fans, sending several flying into the air and dragging at least four under its wheels. Police identified the driver as ‘53-year-old white British man to cool social media speculation’ When the vehicle stopped, angry people converged on it and began smashing the windows as police officers battled to prevent them from reaching the driver. Police said 50 people, including children, had been treated for their injuries, with 11 still in hospital. “They are all in a stable condition, and I am pleased to say that they appear to be recovering well,” Deputy Chief Constable Jenny Sims said. King Charles, who is visiting Canada, said he was  “deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the terrible events”. His sister, Princess Anne, met medics who had treated some of the injured at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Million people With most people off work for the Spring Bank Holiday, officials estimated that around 1 million people descended on the 10-mile (16 km) parade route to watch the Liverpool team travel through the city on an open-top bus with the Premier League trophy. Liverpool last won the league in 2020, ending a 30-year-wait, but fans were unable to celebrate due to lockdowns during the pandemic. Police said the car hit the spectators as the event was winding down. In the aftermath, a photographer saw emergency services carrying victims on stretchers and in their arms to nearby ambulances. One source told MailOnline that it looked like the driver panicked when he realised he was in the crowd and people started banging on his car. The driver, who was sounding his horn, reversed and then accelerated forwards, according to reports from other witnesses. Police were unusually quick to provide a description of the man they arrested, saying around two hours after the incident he was a  “53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area.”  Former police officers and local politicians said that statement was needed to cool social media speculation that the episode was an Islamist attack. “That was one of my first concerns, that we needed to get the story out quickly,” Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram told the BBC . “If there’s a vacuum, we know there are some elements that will try to inflame the situation and to create that speculation and to put misinformation out there.” Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "description": "SUCCESSFUL defence against India’s unwarranted aggression is certainly a great accomplishment and a matter of pride for the nation and the security forces. Yet a victory celebration in an ongoing conflict seems premature. The exchange of missiles and drones may have stopped, but the tension between the two countries is far from over. In the words of the Indian prime minister, it’s just a “pause”. It’s an extremely dangerous situation that needs caution and not triumphalism. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s comment that Pakistan has taken revenge for the 1971 war seems highly questionable. Is there really any comparison between a war that led to the disintegration of the country and defeating the recent Indian attack? The 1971 tragedy was more than India’s military invasion; it was also a war within that we as a nation must never forget. The tragedy is etched in our conscience. Attempts to politicise national security must also be avoided. The Indian aggression has united the country across the political spectrum. Political parties set aside their differences and stood behind the armed forces. But soon after the hostilities eased the daggers were out again, not realising the serious challenges the nation’s security continues to confront. The major responsibility obviously lies with the government to bring down the political temperature as the threat of another Indian escalation looms large. A politically divided country weakens the country’s defence. Then there is also a question about the elevation of the army chief to field marshal and the extension in the air force chief’s tenure. Undoubtedly all the three forces did remarkably well in thwarting the Indian attack. The air force particularly played the most critical role not only in defending our airspace but also downing several Indian aircraft. It re-established Pakistan’s deterrence even in the conventional field. There is also no doubting of the leadership of the army chief. Most troubling for India has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration. Still, it’s difficult to understand the need to promote the army chief to the highest position just on the basis of four days of conflict. It was certainly not winning an all-out war. Gen Munir is the second military chief to be promoted to the five-star rank after Ayub Khan, the country’s first military dictator. While giving full marks to the professional capabilities of our armed forces in taking on a much more powerful adversary, there is also a need to do a critical assessment of our vulnerabilities. It must be a cause for concern that the Indian missiles managed to hit some of our key airbases, including Nur Khan Airbase close to the capital. Surely the damage was not as much as being claimed by the Indian prime minister. Nevertheless, these gaps have to be plugged, as another Indian military strike seems very much on the cards. The four-day military face-off that drove the two nuclear-armed neighbours close to a full-blown war also brought to the fore the fast-shifting regional and global geopolitics. India’s expectation of winning international approval for its military operation against Pakistan in response to the terrorist attack at a tourist spot in disputed territory failed miserably. Perhaps the most shocking development for the Modi government was President Trump’s claim to have brokered the ceasefire using trade as leverage. One of the reasons for India’s failure to muster support for its military action even from its strategic allies in the West was that it failed to provide any solid evidence of Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India mostly relied on past incidents that allegedly had links to local militant groups. Israel was perhaps the only country which publicly backed India’s military action against Pakistan. Another plausible reason for the US and other Western countries to counsel restraint to both states was the fear of the conflict turning into a nuclear confrontation; this would have had disastrous consequences for global peace. The Modi government in its hubris completely miscalculated India’s strategic and economic importance. But it will be a mistake to read too much into Trump’s offer to mediate between the two countries on Kashmir and other outstanding issues. No external mediation will be accepted by New Delhi. Moreover, India remains a strategic ally of the US despite the friction between the two countries on trade and tariffs issues. But there is certainly an opportunity for Pakistan to reset its relations with Washington. Most troubling for India, however, has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration. Pakistan’s spectacular success in air warfare is largely the result of our strategic alliance with China. Besides close cooperation between the two air forces, the China-Pakistan naval axis is also visible. Pakistan and China both share security, military, and financial concerns. Advancing and reinforcing conventional and strategic relations with China is an essential component of Pakistan’s foreign and national security policies. Beijing, however, would not like the conflict between its two nuclear-armed neighbours to escalate. Surely any fresh flare-up between India and Pakistan will have serious implications for the entire region and beyond. It now seems that the battlefront has moved to the field of diplomacy with both countries sending teams to various capitals to explain their respective positions on the sources of conflict. It’s obvious that both sides will be raising the issue of terrorism apparently being used against each other as a tool in the ongoing covert war. But there are limits to what the international community can do in bringing the two countries together on the negotiating table. Both sides have now declared victory in a conflict that has resolved nothing. It’s a war without an end.

      "title": "Analysis: 27 years after Chagai: nuclear shadows & doctrinal dilemma",
      "description": "Twenty-seven years after Pakistan’s nuclear tests, a pressing doctrinal dilemma has come into focus: while the nuclear ars­enal has succeeded in deterring full-scale war, a troubling pattern has emerged — India’s growing reliance on calculated and limited conventional strikes. This evolving challenge requires a clear and adaptive strategy to effectively counter it. These operations, which Delhi has designed to stay below the nuclear threshold, have manifested the shrinking space in which our deterrence operates in the highly volatile South Asian environment. The time has come to rethink and update our understanding of deterrence — one that reflects the realities of today, where conflict no longer arrives with armies massing at borders, but with drones in the sky and missiles that strike and disappear before the world has time to respond. On May 7, India launched “Operation Sindoor” — a coordinated assault involving air strikes, drone swarms, and missile attacks deep inside Pakistani territory. The strikes hit a disturbing range of targets from religious institutions like mosques to strategic military installations. Pakistani armed forces that follow a “quid pro quo plus” policy with regards to India, responded robustly and swiftly, downing multiple Indian aircraft — including Rafale, Mirage 2000, MiG-29, and Su-30 jets in a short span of less than an hour — employing stand-off weapons and air defence systems to signal its resolve. But instead of de-escalating, India escalated further. Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus aims at preventing all-out conflicts, but India’s reckless behaviour to expand geographic scope of its strikes risks miscalculation resulting in a nuclear catastrophe By the next morning, a wave of drones swarmed Pakistani skies, followed a day later by fresh missile attacks on airbases. It was a moment of real danger. The international community scrambled to contain what was quickly becoming a runaway crisis. Deterrence, while not broken, was undeniably shaken. India’s willingness to act and expand geographic scope of its strikes, echoing Uri in 2016 and Pulwama-Balakot in 2019, points to a gap in Pakistan’s ability to deter reckless Indian behaviour due to emergence of newer technologies. To put it simply, Pakistan’s shield is holding, though it may be fraying at the edges. Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme, born from the trauma of 1971, was built on a simple promise: to make any future aggression against the country unthinkable. Between 1998 and 2015, that promise largely held. Even during moments of extreme tension like the Kargil crisis of 1999, months-long military standoff in 2002 or the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, India refrained from crossing the Line of Control and the international border or undertaking major strike in Pakistani heartland. But that calculus began to shift post-2015 especially following the Gurdaspur attack barely weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif at Ufa. First came the claimed “surgical strikes”, then the 2019 aerial incursion following Pulwama. “South Asia has neither crisis stability nor arms race stability. While I do not expect a crisis for some time — perhaps several years — the region remains unstable and dangerous,” said Chris­to­­pher Clary, a security aff­airs expert at the University at Albany, the US. The May 2025 clash — an intense 88-hour exchange of air strikes, drones, and missile fire — marked a deeper evolution of this trend of a rapid escalation under the nuclear overhang. It laid bare a dangerous new reality: India believes it can operate in a “grey zone” just below the nuclear threshold, using limited, precise force to impose costs without triggering all-out war. Indian leaders appear beholden to the idea that they can hit Pakistan without provoking an uncontrollable escalation. From Uri to Balakot, and now Pahalgam, the visible trend is that each strike is a calculated test of Pakistani resolve, and each one pushes the boundaries a little further. Pakistan’s “quid pro quo plus” policy, adopted after 2016, meant to meet Indian aggression with a harder blow, aimed to slam this door of a military conflict below nuclear rung shut. But three incidents in nine years show Pakistani “plus” isn’t scaring India enough. The policy’s success is bittersweet: it prevents all-out conflict, but India does exploit some space to commit aggression. Elizabeth Threlkeld, director for South Asia at the Stimson Center, the US, agrees “the limitations of Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus approach are becoming more visible in light of India’s increasing willingness to engage in limited conventional actions.” Misstep towards catastrophe Each Indian operation is designed to normalise limited raids in the eyes of the world. If this continues, and strikes on mainland Pakistan are repeated, it would increase the risk of a misstep towards nuclear catastrophe as each crisis raises the stakes. Getting an opportunity to dump the payload on a Balakot hill in 2019 gave way to mainland strikes in 2025, setting a higher baseline for the next clash. A more worrying aspect is that if this cycle will persist, each round will compress decision making windows in a world of hypersonic weapons. India’s playbook is clear: use modern technology — drones, standoff missiles — to inflict pain while staying below nuclear tripwires. Modi is therefore attempting, at least on his part, to rewrite the rules, projecting strength to domestic audiences and signalling that Pakistan’s nuclear shadow won’t paralyse India. Whispers of pre-emptive counterforce strategies, meanwhile, have in the past few years circulated with growing frequency, though such a gamble remains improbable. “In March 2022, an Indian BrahMos missile landed in Mian Channu. Delhi called it an error, Pakistani leadership accepted the explanation, but I saw it as a deliberate test of our defences, including our response time. BrahMos is central to India’s pre-emptive strike plans, its speed and precision leave little time to respond, making such incidents dangerously destabilising for Pakistan,” Dr Shireen Mazari, who was a federal minister in 2022, said, alluding to the debates within the system at that time. India’s confidence in multi-domain warfare, blending crewed and uncrewed platforms, creates a false sense of control, as if escalation can be neatly managed. The proponents of such an approach forget that wars don’t always proceed as per calculated decisions, rather they often unravel through confusion. A single misstep, like a missile or an artillery piece gone astray or a misunderstood signal, can unravel restraint and push a tense standoff into full-blown catastrophe. What makes it scarier in Indian case is that the extremist Hindutva mindset currently dominating New Delhi and electoral pressures push the government to demonstrate strength through limited strikes, confident they can avoid nuclear escalation. This dynamic perpetuates the very crises their leaders must manage. “The very presence of recurring conventional engagements highlights the precariousness of the situation, where misperceptions of red lines could lead to inadvertent escalation between the two nuclear-armed adversaries,” Threlkeld maintained. Deception or internal dysfunction? Following India’s aerial strikes on the morning of May 7 and Pakistan’s forceful retaliation, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval conveyed messages through international intermediaries indicating that New Delhi wanted to de-escalate. But to Islamabad’s surprise, shortly after it received these signals, Pakistan’s airspace was swarmed by hostile drones. Whether this was a deliberate act of deception or a sign of internal dysfunction within the Indian system remains unclear. However, one plausible explanation is that hardliners within India’s security establishment pressured the military to climb the next rung of the escalation ladder — targeting Pakistani military installations with unmanned platforms, despite diplomatic overtures suggesting restraint. In this scenario, Pakistan faces a stark choice: continue pursuing a doctrine that punishes India after the incident or forge one that stops India cold. First, there is a need to strengthen our conventional arsenal, which includes acquisition of modern fighter jets, advanced air defences, rapid-response units, and precision munitions, to make limited strikes too costly. Second, ambiguity, using cyber-attacks, economic pressure, or international legal action to raise India’s costs without nuclear risks, should be embraced. The ‘catalytic posture’, which involves signalling nuclear readiness to draw international mediation has worked well so far in South Asian environment, but its overuse risks diminishing returns. Dr Adil Sultan, a dean at the Air University and a former SPD official, while explaining his vision of next generation of deterrence, said, “The future conflict is likely to be more intense, complex, and short, thus requiring quick response through ‘multi-domain integration’ (MDI) of all three services, and ground and space-based assets, with PAF being in the lead due to its inherent agility and capacity to act in a shortest possible time with maximum effect.” Pakistan should also re-emphasise red lines through robust crisis channels especially after the targeting of the airbases. So here we are back, 27 years later, on the same razor’s edge — thanks to the technological advancement. The nuclear bombs remain the ultimate guarantor of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but every knife-edge attack or missile/drone strike cannot be stopped. The nukes can only promise that if the worst comes, both sides will pay an unthinkable price. Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "translatedTitle": "Analysis: 27 years after Chagai: nuclear shadows & doctrinal dilemma",
      "translatedDescription": "Twenty-seven years after Pakistan’s nuclear tests, a pressing doctrinal dilemma has come into focus: while the nuclear ars­enal has succeeded in deterring full-scale war, a troubling pattern has emerged — India’s growing reliance on calculated and limited conventional strikes. This evolving challenge requires a clear and adaptive strategy to effectively counter it. These operations, which Delhi has designed to stay below the nuclear threshold, have manifested the shrinking space in which our deterrence operates in the highly volatile South Asian environment. The time has come to rethink and update our understanding of deterrence — one that reflects the realities of today, where conflict no longer arrives with armies massing at borders, but with drones in the sky and missiles that strike and disappear before the world has time to respond. On May 7, India launched “Operation Sindoor” — a coordinated assault involving air strikes, drone swarms, and missile attacks deep inside Pakistani territory. The strikes hit a disturbing range of targets from religious institutions like mosques to strategic military installations. Pakistani armed forces that follow a “quid pro quo plus” policy with regards to India, responded robustly and swiftly, downing multiple Indian aircraft — including Rafale, Mirage 2000, MiG-29, and Su-30 jets in a short span of less than an hour — employing stand-off weapons and air defence systems to signal its resolve. But instead of de-escalating, India escalated further. Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus aims at preventing all-out conflicts, but India’s reckless behaviour to expand geographic scope of its strikes risks miscalculation resulting in a nuclear catastrophe By the next morning, a wave of drones swarmed Pakistani skies, followed a day later by fresh missile attacks on airbases. It was a moment of real danger. The international community scrambled to contain what was quickly becoming a runaway crisis. Deterrence, while not broken, was undeniably shaken. India’s willingness to act and expand geographic scope of its strikes, echoing Uri in 2016 and Pulwama-Balakot in 2019, points to a gap in Pakistan’s ability to deter reckless Indian behaviour due to emergence of newer technologies. To put it simply, Pakistan’s shield is holding, though it may be fraying at the edges. Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme, born from the trauma of 1971, was built on a simple promise: to make any future aggression against the country unthinkable. Between 1998 and 2015, that promise largely held.

      "description": "WHAT’S the budget if not ‘strategic’? A mere accounting exercise; an attempt at balancing income and expenditure of the government? Well, the fact is that most budgets in the past have been devoid of any strategic direction. Now, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has promised to introduce “bold measures” in the upcoming budget to steer the economy in a “strategic direction”. What he means by bold measures or strategic direction remains unclear. The only hint he has dropped so far about the “strategic direction” concerns plans to expand the restructured debt management office’s goal “beyond reducing interest payments, and instead create economic value” or ‘Alpha’, a term used in finance to describe an investment strategy’s ability to beat the market, to put the economy on a sustainable growth path. “That is where we are going to bring very bold measures in the coming budget to give strategic direction where the economy is headed, and change the DNA of the economy and not to just give an account of expenditure and revenue,” he told a gathering on Monday. Besides, he has promised to simplify tax returns for salaried individuals and significantly increase the defence budget next year in view of the Indian threat. There’s no reason to doubt the government plans to give a strategic direction to the economy in the next budget. That said, the next budget has to primarily focus on fiscal consolidation if the country intends to keep receiving multilateral dollars going forward, as well as avoid the temptation to pump imported growth to stave off another boom-bust episode. There is already some anxiety in the market regarding the ‘inconclusive’ talks with the IMF on the government’s budget proposals, especially the ones related to the increase in defence spending, tax relief for salaried individuals and the real estate sector, and cuts in public sector expenditures. The fund appears to be concerned over the hole these steps would create in the budget, and wants the authorities to identify alternative sources to cover the gap. Perhaps the single most important and bold strategic measure that the minister can introduce in the budget relates to reforms focused on increasing the tax base for boosting tax-to-GDP ratio to the globally acceptable range of 18-20pc of the size of the economy. This will not just create fiscal room for raising the defence expenditure and somewhat reduce the tax burden on salaried households and the corporate sector, but also create room to deepen the recent recovery and push the economy towards sustainable growth. But it again depends on how the authorities define strategic and whether real tax reforms fall in that category. Nothing can be bolder or more strategic than taxing incomes from the retail, agriculture, real estate and other sectors still operating outside the system. Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",

      "description": "Après son inculpation le 27 mai 2025, le juge d’instruction près le tribunal de grande instance du Mfoundi a ordonné que Dagobert Nwafo soit placé sous mandat de dépôt à la prison centrale de Yaoundé. Deux semaines après avoir tué Mathis de coups de poignards, Dagobert Nwafo est placé en détention à la prison centrale de Kondengui à Yaoundé. Sur ordonnance et mandat du juge d’instruction près le tribunal de grande instance du Mfoundi, le magistrat Jean Daniel Lembe Toto, le commissaire central n°1 l’a déposé hier à la maison d’arrêt. Il y a passé sa première nuit et y restera jusqu’au 27 novembre 2025, date à laquelle le régisseur de prison le présentera au cabinet du juge d’instruction. Après l’enquête préliminaire, Dagobert Nwafo est inculpé « d’assassinat » et c’est à ce titre qu’il est poursuivi devant la justice camerounaise. L’infraction est prévue et punie par les articles 74 et 276 du Code pénal . Alors que l’article 74 donne les caractéristiques d’une personne pénalement responsable, l’article 276 traite de l’assassinat proprement dit. Aux termes de cet articles intitulé assassinat, « est puni de mort, le meurtre commis soit : a) avec préméditation, b) par empoisonnement, c) pour procéder au trafic des organes de la victime (…) ». Au terme de la procédure judiciaire, le tribunal prononcera le jugement dans lequel la condamnation définitive sera connue. Pour l’instant, au regard de l’inculpation, l’accusé risque la peine de mort. La procédure est parvenue à cette étape plus de deux semaines après la mort du petit Mathis dont le corps est scellé à la morgue. Dans une interview accordée à nos confrères de la CRTV télé, le préfet du Mfoundi a expliqué pourquoi les autorités ont pris 18 jours pour l’enquête préliminaire alors que toutes les preuves semblaient être réunies depuis la commission des faits. Emmanuel Mariel Djikdent a déclaré « qu’il y a des actes à poser avant pour que le dossier soit bien complet.  Je peux vous dire qu’il fallait quand même poser certains actes par des professionnels, notamment un médecin légiste qui devait faire l’autopsie ». Pendant ce temps, l’indignation de l’opinion montait. De nombreuses figures connues, en particulier de la scène musicale et de la défense des droits des femmes commençaient à crier à l’injustice et à demander la célérité dans le traitement du dossier de dagobert Nwafo. Son déferrement à la prison survient au lendemain de la descente devant le commissariat d’un groupe de femmes vêtues de noir en signe de protestation.

      "translatedTitle": "What Dagobert Nwafo risks, alleged assassin of Mathis, in detention in Kondengui prison",
      "translatedDescription": "After his charge on May 27, 2025, the investigating judge at the MFoundi tribunal de grande instance ordered that Dagobert Nwafo be placed under a deposit warrant at Yaoundé central prison. Two weeks after killing Mathis with daggers, Dagobert Nwafo is placed in detention at Kondengui central prison in Yaoundé. On the prescription and mandate of the investigating judge at the Mfoundi tribunal de grande instance, the magistrate Jean Daniel Lembe Toto, the central commissioner No. 1 put him yesterday at the remand center. He spent his first night there and will stay there until November 27, 2025, the date on which the prison manager will present him to the cabinet of the investigating judge. After the preliminary investigation, Dagobert Nwafo is charged \"assassination\" and it is in this capacity that he was prosecuted before the Cameroonian justice. The offense is provided for and punished by articles 74 and 276 of the Criminal Code. While article 74 gives the characteristics of a criminally responsible person, article 276 deals with the assassination proper. Under the terms of this articles entitled Assassination, \"is punished with death, the murder committed either: a) with premeditation, b) by poisoning, c) to carry out the organs of the victim (...)\". At the end of the legal proceedings, the court will pronounce the judgment in which the final conviction will be known. For the moment, with regard to charges, the accused risks the death penalty. The procedure has reached this stage more than two weeks after the death of little Mathis whose body is sealed in the morgue. In an interview with our colleagues from the CRTV Télé, the prefect of the MFoundi explained why the authorities took 18 days for the preliminary investigation when all the evidence seemed to be gathered from the fact commission. Emmanuel Mariel Djikdent said \"that there are acts to be carried out before the case is complete.  I can tell you that we still had to take certain acts by professionals, including a medical examiner who was to do the autopsy. \" Meanwhile, the indignation of opinion rose. Many known figures, in particular the music scene and the defense of the rights of women began to shout in injustice and to ask for speed in the processing of Dagobert Nwafo's file. His swapping in prison occurs the day after the descent before the police station of a group of women dressed in black as a sign of protest.

La oposición tenía lista una moción con alrededor de 74 diputados para aprobar el acta de la moción anterior, en virtud de que tenían informes que la Junta Directiva, quería aprobar convenios y préstamos internacionales metiendo en el fondo el presupuesto de las elecciones de noviembre del Consejo Nacional Electoral. La oposición exigía aprobar el acta y en una nueva sesión conocer y aprobar el presupuesto de 1,737 millones de lempiras que el CNE ha pedido para las elecciones de este año, según lo dio a conocer la consejera presidenta del Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE), Cossette López. Diputados de la oposición están a la expectativa de ser convocados nuevamente, por lo que no quieren abandonar el Hemiciclo Legislativo, arguyendo que podría haber un “madrugón”. “Ahí están todos los de la bancada de Libre sentados, yo supongo que lo que quieren es que nos vayamos, convocar y aprobar esto sin el cuórum debido, otro madrugón”, manifestó Jorge Cálix , instando a presupuesto de elecciones.",

Por más de 40 minutos, el grupo enardecido lanzó piedras a la Policía hasta que logró dispersarlos. Casi a las 12:00 m, el paso de vehículos pudo restablecerse, pero quedaron varios camiones con parte de los contenedores quemados. Unos que iban cargados de maíz y arroz y casi todo el producto quedó regado en la carretera. Ante los daños, la respuesta del gerente de Consejo Hondureño de la Empresa Privada (Cohep), Santiago Herrera, no se hizo esperar, expresando que la paralización de la vía en Choloma representa 33.8 millones de dólares de pérdidas diarias, equivalentes a casi 900 millones de lempiras.

Ante el problema de Koriun, la empresa privada ha dado a conocer que el Estado debió proceder de inmediato a tomar acciones dentro del marco de la ley y cumplir con los procedimientos. Pero tras la intervención que hizo el Ministerio Público y la Comisión Nacional de Bancos y Seguros (CNBS), no pudieron garantizar el pago de capital a muchos de los socios con más de L428 millones que tenía Koriun en efectivo y en cuentas bancarias. El dinero quedó en manos del gerente Iván Velásquez, a quien dejaron solo en las oficinas y no garantizaron que devolviera el dinero a los clientes. Roberto Talavera, abogado defensor de Velásquez, indicó ofrecieron la colaboración para entregar el dinero a los inversionistas, pero la Fiscalía ofrece aceptar un procedimiento abreviado.

      "description": "Eduardo Enrique Reina ha renunciado este martes al cargo de Secretario de Estado en los Despachos de Relaciones Exteriores y Cooperación Internacional , así lo dio a conocer él mediante sus redes sociales. Reina indica que su renuncia se debe a que tendrá el honor de acompañar a la abogada Rixi Moncada Godoy en su fórmula presidencial, de cara a las eleciones generales de diciembre. Señora Presidenta: Tengo el honor de dirigirme a usted, en ocasión de presentarle mi más profundo agradecimiento, por haberme concedido el privilegio de acompañarla en estos tres años y cuatro meses de su Gobierno del Socialismo Democrático, como su Secretario de Estado en los Despachos de Relaciones Exteriores y Cooperación Internacional y apoyarla en la ejecución de su Política Exterior, al frente de la Cancillería hondureña. Ha sido una oportunidad única el haber contribuido en el desarrollo de los pilares fundamentales de su gestión en política internacional, poniendo el beneficio del Pueblo hondureño como objetivo fundamental y creando una actividad diplomática y consular en pro de nuestros compatriotas migrantes, con una atención más humana, profesional, eficiente, digna y respetuosa. Trabajamos en el afianzamiento de las relaciones con países amigos, y generamos mayor apertura y presencia internacional para nuestro país, fomentando el acercamiento a otras regiones del mundo. Pudimos avanzar exitosamente en los compromisos internacionales, logramos incrementos en la cooperación y la política exterior, fomentar nuestros productos y exportaciones, atraer inversiones y trabajar en los distintos temas y retos mundiales como el cambio climático y la lucha contra la pobreza y la desigualdad. Todo este proceso de relaciones externas se han construido sobre la base del respeto a nuestra soberanía, al Derecho Internacional y a los principios, de autodeterminación de los pueblos, no injerencia y no intervención en asuntos internos, promoviendo en todo momento la búsqueda de la paz y el diálogo. Cabe señalar que un logro fundamental ha sido lograr, bajo su liderazgo, recuperar la imagen de Honduras en el exterior después de 12 años y 7 meses de Narco-Dictadura. Esta ocasión, en un sentimiento agridulce por dejar su Administración, asumimos una nueva etapa para cumplir con los designios de nuestro Partido, Libertad y Refundación “Libre” y gracias al voto libre, democrático, soberano y transparente de nuestro Pueblo, tener el honor de acompañar a la abogada Rixi Moncada Godoy en su fórmula presidencial. En esta nueva etapa política lucharemos para dar continuidad a todos los logros que usted ha llevado a cabo y lograr el triunfo y continuar en el proceso de Refundación de la Patria. En este sentido, me permito presentar ante usted mi renuncia irrevocable a partir del día miércoles 28 de mayo de 2025 , al cargo de Secretario de Estado en los Despachos de Relaciones Exteriores y Cooperación Internacional. Acepte señora presidenta, las seguridades de mi más alta consideración y aprecio.",

      "translatedDescription": "Eduardo Enrique Reina has resigned on Tuesday to the position of Secretary of State in the Foreign Relations and International Cooperation offices, he announced it through his social networks. Reina indicates that his resignation is because he will have the honor of accompanying lawyer Rixi Moncada Godoy in her presidential formula, in the face of the general election of December. Mrs. President: I have the honor of addressing you, on the occasion of presenting my deepest thanks, for having granted me the privilege of accompanying her in these three years and four months of her government of democratic socialism, such as your secretary of state in the offices of Foreign Relations and International Cooperation and support it in the execution of its foreign policy, in front of the Honduran Foreign Ministry. It has been a unique opportunity to have contributed to the development of the fundamental pillars of their management in international politics, putting the benefit of the Honduran people as a fundamental objective and creating a diplomatic and consular activity in favor of our migrant compatriots, with more human, professional, efficient, decent and respectful attention. We work in the consolidation of relations with friendly countries, and generate greater opening and international presence for our country, promoting the approach to other regions of the world. We were able to advance successfully in international commitments, we achieved increases in cooperation and foreign policy, encourage our products and exports, attract investments and work on the different world issues and challenges such as climate change and the fight against poverty and inequality. This whole external relations process has been built on the basis of respect for our sovereignty, international law and principles, self -determination of peoples, not intervention and non -intervention in internal matters, promoting at all times the search for peace and dialogue. It should be noted that a fundamental achievement has been to achieve, under its leadership, recover the image of Honduras abroad after 12 years and 7 months of narco-dictatorship. This occasion, in a bittersweet feeling for leaving its administration, we assume a new stage to comply with the designs of our party, freedom and “free” recast and thanks to the free, democratic, sovereign and transparent vote of our people, to have the honor of accompanying lawyer Rixi Moncada Godoy in her presidential formula. In this new political stage we will fight to give continuity to all the achievements that you have carried out and achieve triumph and continue in the process of re -founding the homeland. In this sense, I allow myself to present to you my irrevocable resignation as of Wednesday, May 28, 2025, to the position of Secretary of State in the Offices of Foreign Relations and International Cooperation. Accept Lady President, the assurances of my highest consideration and appreciation.",

      "title": "AMC y SIP condenan ataques de las Fuerzas Armadas a la prensa en Honduras",
      "description": "La Asociación de Medios de Comunicación de Honduras (AMC) y la Sociedad Interamericana de Prensa (SIP) condenaron enérgicamente los ataques de las Fuerzas Armadas y la Secretaría de Defensa contra periodistas, a quienes han señalado públicamente como enemigos del Estado. El episodio ha sido calificado como una escalada sin precedentes en la intimidación sistemática contra la libertad de expresión y de prensa en Honduras. “Han pasado de ser una amenaza velada a la libertad de expresión, a convertirse en una amenaza a la integridad de los periodistas desde la estructura del Estado, algo que ni siquiera se vio en la Guerra Fría”, advierte la AMC. La AMC lamentó que sean precisamente las Fuerzas Armadas y la Secretaría de Defensa, instituciones que ostentan poder delegado por el pueblo hondureño, las que se alcen contra la libertad de expresión, poniendo en peligro las vidas de periodistas que ejercen un periodismo independiente, responsable y serio, “siendo baluartes en la defensa de la democracia”. “La actitud tanto de las FF AA como de la Secretaría de Defensa no compagina con la tolerancia que están obligadas a guardar ambas por la Ley, al régimen de opinión pública, cuya labor está establecida en la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, la Declaración Universal de los Derechos Humanos, la Convención Americana sobre Derechos Humanos, el Pacto de San José, la Declaración de Chapultepec y la Ley de Emisión del Pensamiento en Honduras como derecho y obligación de los medios de comunicación, para garantizar las libertades de la sociedad”, condenó la AMC. Asimismo, exhortó “con urgencia la protección inmediata de los periodistas Rodrigo Wong Arévalo, Dagoberto Rodríguez Coello y Juan Carlos Sierra, quienes han quedado expuestos a sufrir cualquier tipo de atentado que ponga en riesgo su vida”. La organización también reprochó “la actitud totalmente antidemocrática de las FF AA y la Secretaría de Defensa”, y pidió a las instituciones del Estado, organismos internacionales y a la comunidad internacional que intercedan “para proteger la libertad de expresión en Honduras y la vida de los tres periodistas”. La AMC responsabilizó a ambas instituciones “por los daños que pudieran sufrir nuestros afiliados”. La denuncia se produce tras la publicación del 26 de mayo en el medio oficial FF AA Digital, bajo el título “Sicarios de la verdad” , donde se presentó en portada un artículo acompañado de fotografías de tres reconocidos periodistas: Rodrigo Wong Arévalo, director del programa Abriendo Brecha y propietario de Canal 10; Dagoberto Rodríguez, director de Radio Cadena Voces y Premio Álvaro Contreras 2025; y Juan Carlos Sierra, presidente del Colegio de Periodistas de Honduras (CPH). En la publicación, los comunicadores fueron acusados de ser “enemigos del Estado”, sin ofrecer pruebas, en lo que la SIP calificó como “una clara campaña de desprestigio, intimidación y criminalización del ejercicio periodístico”. Este ataque habría surgido tras declaraciones críticas de Dagoberto Rodríguez durante la ceremonia del Premio Álvaro Contreras, en la que denunció irregularidades atribuidas a las Fuerzas Armadas durante las elecciones internas del 9 de marzo, como “la entrega tardía de maletas electorales en centros de Tegucigalpa y San Pedro Sula”. La SIP también expresó su más enérgico repudio a esta ofensiva contra medios y periodistas. José Roberto Dutriz, presidente de la SIP y director de La Prensa Gráfica de El Salvador, afirmó que “el acoso judicial y la estigmatización pública se han convertido en armas sistemáticas para intentar silenciar al periodismo, especialmente cuando se exponen actos de corrupción y abuso de poder”. Martha Ramos, directora editorial de la Organización Editorial Mexicana (OEM) y presidenta de la Comisión de Libertad de Prensa e Información de la SIP, advirtió que “no se trata solo de un agravio a tres periodistas, sino de un mensaje peligroso para toda la prensa crítica del país”. “Cuando las Fuerzas Armadas utilizan su aparato de comunicación para amedrentar, están sobrepasando los límites que deben respetar en una democracia. Ese tipo de conducta no puede normalizarse”, declaró. La SIP recordó también que, en febrero pasado, el alto mando militar impulsó acciones judiciales contra 12 medios de comunicación para obligarlos a revelar sus fuentes, lo que fue calificado como una grave violación de los principios periodísticos y del derecho internacional. El Colegio de Periodistas de Honduras (CPH) condenó enérgicamente la publicación y responsabilizó al jefe del Estado Mayor Conjunto, Roosevelt Hernández, y a la hasta ayer ministra de Defensa, Rixi Moncada, por cualquier atentado, hostigamiento o daño que puedan sufrir los periodistas mencionados. El Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos (Conadeh) también se pronunció, recordando al Estado su deber de proteger la libertad de pensamiento y expresión. “La libertad de expresión protege incluso aquello que incomoda a autoridades o sectores sociales, especialmente cuando se trata de temas de interés público”, indicó la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, citada por el Conadeh. Blanca Izaguirre, titular del organismo, subrayó que “la libertad de expresión es un pilar esencial del Estado de derecho, especialmente cuando se ejerce como veeduría social ante actos de la administración pública”. El Conadeh exhortó a la institucionalidad a abstenerse de emitir pronunciamientos que intimiden, directa o indirectamente, a periodistas y medios de comunicación.",

      "translatedDescription": "The Association of Media of Honduras (AMC) and the Inter -American Press Society (SIP) strongly condemned the attacks of the Armed Forces and the Secretariat of Defense against Journalists, whom they have publicly pointed out as enemies of the State. The episode has been qualified as an unprecedented escalation in systematic intimidation against freedom of expression and press in Honduras. \"They have gone from being a veiled threat to freedom of expression, to become a threat to the integrity of journalists from the structure of the State, something that was not even seen in the cold war,\" warns the AMC. The AMC regretted that they are precisely the Armed Forces and the Secretariat of Defense, institutions that hold power delegated by the Honduran people, which are raised against freedom of expression, endangering the lives of journalists who exercise independent, responsible and serious journalism, \"being bastions in the defense of democracy.\" “The attitude of both the FF AA and the Ministry of Defense does not compare guarantee the freedoms of society, ”said the AMC. He also urgently urged the immediate protection of journalists Rodrigo Wong Arévalo, Dagoberto Rodríguez Coello and Juan Carlos Sierra, who have been exposed to suffer any type of attack that puts their lives at risk. \" The organization also reproached \"the totally antidemocratic attitude of the FF AA and the Secretariat of Defense,\" and asked the State institutions, international organizations and the international community to intercede \"to protect freedom of expression in Honduras and the life of the three journalists.\" The AMC responsible for both institutions \"for the damages that our affiliates could suffer.\" The complaint occurs after the publication of May 26 in the official FF AA Digital, under the title “Sicarios de la Truth”, where an article accompanied by photographs of three renowned journalists was presented on the cover: Rodrigo Wong Arévalo, director of the program opening the gap and owner of Channel 10; Dagoberto Rodríguez, director of Radio Cadena Voces and Álvaro Contreras 2025; and Juan Carlos Sierra, president of the College of Journalists of Honduras (CPH). In the publication, the communicators were accused of being \"enemies of the State\", without offering evidence, in what the SIP described as \"a clear campaign of discredit, intimidation and criminalization of the journalistic exercise.\" This attack would have emerged after critical statements by Dagoberto Rodríguez during the Álvaro Contreras Prize ceremony, in which he denounced irregularities attributed to the Armed Forces during the internal elections of March 9, such as “the late delivery of electoral suitcases in Centers of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula”. The SIP also expressed its most energetic repudiation of this offensive against media and journalists. José Roberto Dutriz, president of the SIP and director of the graphic press of El Salvador, said that \"judicial harassment and public stigmatization have become systematic weapons to try to silence journalism, especially when acts of corruption and abuse of power are exposed.\" Martha Ramos, editorial director of the Mexican Editorial Organization (OEM) and president of the SIP Press and Information Commission, warned that \"it is not just a grievance to three journalists, but a dangerous message for the entire critical press of the country.\" \"When the Armed Forces use their communication apparatus to intimidate, they are exceeding the limits they must respect in a democracy. That type of behavior cannot be normalized,\" he said. The SIP also recalled that, last February, the Military High Command promoted judicial actions against 12 media to force them to reveal their sources, which was qualified as a serious violation of journalistic principles and international law. The College of Journalists of Honduras (CPH) strongly condemned the publication and responsible for the Chief of the Joint Chief, Roosevelt Hernández, and until yesterday Minister of Defense, Rixi Moncada, for any attack, harassment or damage that the aforementioned journalists may suffer. The National Human Rights Commissioner (Conadeh) also pronounced, reminding the State of its duty to protect freedom of thought and expression. \"Freedom of expression even protects what bothers authorities or social sectors, especially when it comes to issues of public interest,\" said the Inter -American Court of Human Rights, cited by Conadeh. Blanca Izaguirre, head of the agency, stressed that \"freedom of expression is an essential pillar of the rule of law, especially when exercised as social veeduría before acts of public administration.\" Conadeh urged institutionality to refrain from issuing pronouncements that intimidate, directly or indirectly, journalists and media.",

      "description": "Habitantes de los campos bananeros de La Lima, Cortés , bloquearon por varias horas la carretera que conduce a El Progreso para exigirle al gobierno la reparación de varios kilómetros de bordos de contención. A la altura de la colonia San José, los manifestantes incendiaron llantas y evitaron que los automóviles hasta que elementos de la Policía Nacional llegaron a desalojarlos bajo una lluvia de piedras que les lanzaron. Armando Velásquez, alcalde auxiliar de Corosalito, líder de la manifestación, dijo ante los medios de comunicación que “los bordos quedarán dañados desde las lluvias Eta y Iota” que afectaron el país en 2020. De acuerdo con explicaciones de Velásquez, los bordos, construidos en las orillas del canal Maya y río Chamelecón , presentan aberturas considerables por las cuales podría filtrarse el agua durante la temporada de lluvias. “Desde la carretera, el bordo se ve bonito, pero está deteriorado (...). Por el lado de las fincas bananeras hay unos 30 boquetes, hay oros frente a la colonia Las Metálicas y hay otros por la finca Omonita”, dijo. Otros habitantes del sector, como José Mariel, le solicitan al gobierno “dejar las mentiras a un lado y ponerse a trabajar de manera inmediata antes de que comiencen las lluvias que provocan inundaciones”. Delmis Cardona, jefe de la Unidad Municipal de Riesgo, le informó a los limeños a través Facebook que constaron que hay daños en los bordos que corresponden a este municipio. “Hay un área de la Lima que ya habíamos denunciado ante la SIT, Centro de Estudios y Desarrollo del Valle de Sula y el señor alcalde había hecho las gestiones para la reparación”, dijo. Propietarios de terrenos aledaños donarán material que será utilizado para hacer reparaciones, según autoridades locales.",

      "translatedDescription": "Inhabitants of the banana fields of the Lima, Cortés, blocked for several hours the road that leads to El Progreso to demand from the Government the repair of several kilometers of containment boards. At the height of the San José neighborhood, the protesters set fire to tires and prevented cars until elements of the National Police came to evict them under a rain of stones that threw them. Armando Velásquez, auxiliary mayor of Corosalito, leader of the demonstration, said before the media that “the embroiders will be damaged from the ETA and Iota rains” that affected the country in 2020. According to Velásquez's explanations, the embroiders, built on the banks of the Maya Canal and Chamelecón River, have considerable openings through which the water could be filtered during the rainy season. \"From the road, the board looks beautiful, but it is deteriorated (...). On the side of the banana farms there are about 30 boquets, there are golds in front of the Las Metal neighborhood and there are others by the omonite farm,\" he said. Other inhabitants of the sector, such as José Mariel, ask the government to \"leave lies aside and get to work immediately before the rains that cause floods begin.\" Delmis Cardona, head of the Municipal Risk Unit, informed the Lima through Facebook that they stated that there are damage to the boards that correspond to this municipality. \"There is an area of ​​the Lima that we had already denounced before the SIT, Center for Studies and Development of the Sula Valley and Mr. Mayor had made the efforts for repair,\" he said. Owners of surrounding land will donate material that will be used to make repairs, according to local authorities.",

      "title": "Tres nombres suenan para sustituir a Rixi Moncada y Enrique Reina",
      "description": "Los nombres de Lesly Sarahí Cerna, Javier Efraín Bu Soto y Dessiré Flores Dubón se manejan en Casa Presidencial como posibles reemplazos de los tres funcionarios de confianza de la presidenta Xiomara Castro que renunciaron a sus cargos para dedicarse a la campaña electoral. Las salidas de Rixi Moncada (Defensa), Eduardo Enrique Reina (Cancillería) y Angélica Álvarez (Derechos Humanos) fueron formalizadas en cumplimiento de la Ley Electoral, que exige a los aspirantes a cargos de elección popular dejar sus funciones seis meses antes de los comicios generales, previstos para el 30 de noviembre. Aunque no hay anuncios oficiales, fuentes del Ejecutivo confirmaron a LA PRENSA que entre miércoles y jueves se oficializarán los nombramientos. Lesly Sarahí Cerna, abogada originaria de Catacamas, Olancho, ha ganado terreno en el círculo más cercano del poder. Su cercanía con la familia presidencial y su rol como operadora política de confianza la perfilan como posible sucesora en la Secretaría de Defensa, tras la salida de Rixi Moncada. Desde el 1 de julio de 2024, Cerna ocupa el cargo de ministra de la Presidencia, posición desde la cual coordina el gabinete y ejerce influencia directa en la agenda del Ejecutivo. Su ascenso fue inmediato tras la salida de Rodolfo Pastor de María y Campos. Formada en la Universidad Católica de Honduras (Unicah), con una maestría en Derecho Empresarial por Unitec y doctorado en Derecho Tributario por la Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala, Cerna inició su trayectoria de alto perfil el 27 de enero de 2022 como secretaria de Trabajo y Seguridad Social. Desde esa posición impulsó una narrativa centrada en los derechos laborales, aunque sin lograr reformas estructurales destacables. En septiembre de 2023, asumió la presidencia del Consejo Económico y Social (CES), desde donde intentó revitalizar el diálogo tripartito entre empleadores, trabajadores y Gobierno, sin mayor impacto sustantivo. Su ambición política quedó evidenciada en junio de 2023 al postularse para fiscal general. Sin embargo, su candidatura fue retirada por no cumplir con la edad mínima ni con experiencia penal, según los criterios legales. El 14 de junio de 2024, la presidenta Xiomara Castro la nombró ministra de la Presidencia, cargo desde el cual se ha desempeñado como brazo ejecutor del Ejecutivo. Su eventual traslado a Defensa supondría una mayor concentración de poder en una figura clave del círculo íntimo de la mandataria. Javier Efraín Bu Soto ha desarrollado una carrera diplomática de bajo perfil, pero con conexiones sólidas en las esferas del poder. Con más de 15 años residiendo en Estados Unidos, Bu ha sabido navegar los espacios de influencia de Washington, gracias a su formación académica y a su pertenencia a una familia con tradición política. A sus 42 años, nació en Tegucigalpa en el seno de una familia con historia en el servicio exterior: su madre fue cónsul en Galveston, Texas, y su abuelo presidió el Congreso Nacional. Su nombre figura como posible sustituto de Eduardo Enrique Reina en la Cancillería. Bu asumió como embajador en EE. UU. en enero de 2023, tras entregar credenciales al presidente Joe Biden. Previamente, desde febrero de 2022, se desempeñó como encargado de negocios en la misma sede diplomática. Su primer acercamiento al servicio exterior se remonta a 2009, cuando fue designado agregado legal en la embajada, en plena crisis tras el golpe de Estado contra Manuel Zelaya. En lo académico, posee doble maestría en Derecho y Gobierno, y Derecho Comercial Internacional por la American University, así como un doctorado en Jurisprudencia por Unitec. Antes de ocupar el rol de embajador, trabajó en el sector privado como director gerente de Group BG, firma vinculada a seguros en Washington, y brevemente como asistente legal en la Corte Suprema de Justicia y el Instituto de la Propiedad, en proyectos financiados por el Banco Mundial. Desde su llegada a la embajada, ha promovido la apertura de consulados en Pittsburgh, Phoenix y Tampa, además de la implementación de consulados móviles. Aunque visibles, estas gestiones han sido más logísticas que estratégicas, en un contexto de desafíos migratorios, diplomáticos y comerciales. Bu también ha sido interlocutor en temas como la renovación del TPS, migración y atracción de inversión, aunque sin protagonismo en negociaciones de alto nivel. Dessiré Flores Dubón es una figura conocida en los círculos de poder, más por su herencia política que por una trayectoria consolidada. Hija de Sonia Marlina Dubón Villeda, magistrada de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, y de Enrique Flores Lanza, exsecretario de la Presidencia durante el gobierno de Manuel Zelaya, actualmente asesora a la Presidencia, Dessiré ocupa hoy la Subsecretaría de la Presidencia y es miembro suplente del Consejo Nacional de Inversiones (CNI). Su nombre suena para reemplazar a Lesly Cerna en la Secretaría de la Presidencia, en caso de que esta última sea trasladada a Defensa. Su ascenso se explica más por los vínculos familiares que por una carrera independiente en lo político o técnico. El 15 de mayo de 2024 fue electa presidenta del Tribunal de Honor del Colegio de Abogados de Honduras (CAH), en una sesión polémica respaldada por los frentes Reivindicador, Gremialista y Patria y Justicia. Sin embargo, su nombramiento fue impugnado por Ana Cardona Herrera, quien alegó haber sido electa previamente en marzo por mayoría de los agremiados. Este episodio expuso tensiones dentro del gremio y cuestionamientos sobre la transparencia en la conformación de liderazgos. Flores Dubón representa una continuidad del proyecto político de Libre en distintas instancias estatales. Su eventual llegada a la Secretaría de la Presidencia implicaría asumir la coordinación del gabinete, el enlace con el Congreso y un rol central en la definición de la agenda del Ejecutivo.

      "translatedTitle": "Three names sound to replace Rixi Moncada and Enrique Reina",
      "translatedDescription": "The names of Lesly Sarahí Cerna, Javier Efraín Bu Soto and Dessiré Flores Dubón are handled at the presidential house as possible replacements of the three trusted officials of President Xiomara Castro who renounced their positions to devote themselves to the electoral campaign. The departures of Rixi Moncada (Defense), Eduardo Enrique Reina (Foreign Ministry) and Angélica Álvarez (Human Rights) were formalized in compliance with the Electoral Law, which requires applicants for positions of popular election to leave their functions six months before the general elections, provided for November 30. Although there are no official ads, executive sources confirmed to the press that the appointments will be formalized between Wednesday and Thursday. Lesly Sarahí Cerna, a lawyer from Catacamas, Olancho, has gained ground in the closest circle of power. Her closeness with the presidential family and her role as a trusted political operator is emerging as a possible successor in the Secretariat of Defense, after the departure of Rixi Moncada. Since July 1, 2024, Cerna occupies the position of Minister of the Presidency, a position from which he coordinates the cabinet and exerts direct influence on the executive agenda. His ascent was immediate after the departure of Rodolfo Pastor de María and Campos. Trained at the Catholic University of Honduras (UNICAH), with a Master in Business Law by UNITEC and a PhD in Tax Law from the University of San Carlos de Guatemala, CERNA began its high -profile career on January 27, 2022 as Secretary of Labor and Social Security. From that position it promoted a narrative focused on labor rights, although without achieving remarkable structural reforms. In September 2023, he assumed the presidency of the Economic and Social Council (CES), from where he tried to revitalize the tripartite dialogue between employers, workers and government, without greater substantive impact. His political ambition was evidenced in June 2023 when he was running for the Attorney General. However, his candidacy was withdrawn for not fulfilling the minimum age or with criminal experience, according to legal criteria. On June 14, 2024, President Xiomara Castro appointed her Minister of the Presidency, a position from which she has served as an executive arm. His eventual transfer to Defense would mean a greater concentration of power in a key figure of the intimate circle of the president. Javier Efraín Bu Soto has developed a low profile diplomatic career, but with solid connections in the spheres of power. With more than 15 years residing in the United States, BU has managed to navigate the spaces of influence of Washington, thanks to his academic training and his belonging to a family with political tradition. At 42, he was born in Tegucigalpa within a family with history in the foreign service: his mother was consul in Galveston, Texas, and his grandfather presided over the National Congress. His name appears as a possible substitute for Eduardo Enrique Reina in the Foreign Ministry. BU assumed as an ambassador to the US. In January 2023, after giving credentials to President Joe Biden. Previously, since February 2022, he served as a business manager at the same diplomatic headquarters. His first approach to the foreign service dates back to 2009, when he was appointed legal aggregate at the embassy, ​​in full crisis after the coup against Manuel Zelaya. In academics, he has double mastery in law and government, and international commercial law from the American University, as well as a doctorate in jurisprudence for UNITEC. Before occupying the role of ambassador, he worked in the private sector as managing director of Group BG, a firm linked to insurance in Washington, and briefly as a legal assistant in the Supreme Court of Justice and the Institute of Property, in projects financed by the World Bank. Since its arrival at the Embassy, ​​it has promoted the opening of consulates in Pittsburgh, Phoenix and Tampa, in addition to the implementation of mobile consulates. Although visible, these efforts have been more logistical than strategic, in a context of migratory, diplomatic and commercial challenges. BU has also been an interlocutor on issues such as the renewal of TPS, migration and investment attraction, although without prominence in high -level negotiations. I will desss Flores Dubón is a figure known in the circles of power, more for its political inheritance than by a consolidated trajectory. Daughter of Sonia Marlina Dubón Villeda, magistrate of the Supreme Court of Justice, and Enrique Flores Lanza, former secretary of the Presidency during the government of Manuel Zelaya, currently advising the presidency, Dessiré occupies today the Undersecretariat of the Presidency and is a substitute member of the National Investment Council (CNI). His name sounds to replace Lesly Cerna in the Secretariat of the Presidency, in case the latter is transferred to Defense. His rise is more explained by family ties than by an independent career in the political or technical. On May 15, 2024, he was elected president of the Court of Honor of the Bar Association of Honduras (CAH), in a controversial session backed by the claiming, union and homeland and justice fronts. However, his appointment was challenged by Ana Cardona Herrera, who claimed to have been previously elected in March by majority of the members. This episode presented tensions within the guild and questions about transparency in the conformation of leadership. Flores Dubón represents a continuity of the political project of free in different state instances. His eventual arrival in the Secretariat of the Presidency would imply assuming the coordination of the cabinet, the link with the Congress and a central role in the definition of the Executive Agenda.

      "title": "Xiomara Castro pide el voto para Rixi durante asamblea de la Amhon en Roatán",
      "description": "La paradisiaca isla de Roatán , en el departamento de Islas de la Bahía, acogió la 34 asamblea de la Asociación de Municipios de Honduras (Amhon), con la participación de los 298 alcaldes y alcaldesas del país. La reunión anual de los ediles comenzó el lunes 26 con la inscripción de los participantes. La presidenta Xiomara Castro fue invitada de honor y llegó este martes al magno evento que se desarrolla en las instalaciones del Ministerio Apostólico Visión del Reino. Asimismo, asistieron Luis Redondo, presidente del Congreso Nacional, y Rebeca Ráquel Obando, presidenta de la Corte Suprema de Justicia. El objetivo de la asamblea de la Amhon es poder desarrollar una plataforma de diálogo y acción conjunta entre los alcaldes y alcaldesas, con el Gobierno Central y la Cooperación Internacional. Uno de los momentos que más llamó la atención de los presentes fue cuando la presidenta Xiomara Castro ofreció en su discurso pidió el voto para Rixi Moncada , candidata del Partido Libertad y Refundación (Libre) en el poder. “Para que todo esto continúe los invito a que apoyemos a la mujer que le dará continuidad a los proyectos de refundación , a la abogada Rixi Moncada Godoy”, expresó la mandataria de los hondureños en Roatán. La invitación a votar por Rixi Moncada, quien este martes presentó su renuncia como ministra de Defensa de cara a las elecciones generales, no fue del agrado para la oposición, ya que aseguraron que no se puede politizar la asamblea de alcaldes. Xiomara Castro mencionó además otros temas de país, impulsando su proyecto de refundación de la patria , el cual debe ser convertido en una práctica cotidiana. Destacó que más de 24 mil millones de lempiras se han transferido puntualmente a las municipalidades en los últimos tres años y cuatro meses de su gestión gubernamental. “Estas transferencias a las municipalidades son una expresión de la voluntad de mi gobierno, desde el socialismo democrático, para descentralizar los recursos del Estado”, apuntó Xiomara Castro. Hizo énfasis en los logros de su gobierno como la reparación de escuelas, construcción de caminos productivos, cajas rurales, pavimentación de carretera s, entre otros proyectos que se realizan con las municipalidades. Castro destacó además la contratación de cinco mil maestros, programa de la merienda escolar y la matrícula gratis que ha restituido el derecho de una educación pública , gratuita, bilingüe y morazanista. Igualmente, reiteró la construcción de ocho hospitales a nivel nacional, un materno infantil, cuatro centros neonatales y dos nosocomios de trauma en San Pedro Sula y Tegucigalpa Rom MacNab, alcalde de Roatán en su condición de anfitrión, dio la bienvenida a los alcaldes del país. \"Gracias por estar aquí. Gracias por lo que hacen cada día desde sus alcaldías. Y gracias por creer, como yo, que desde lo local se puede transformar a Honduras\", acotó. La 34 asamblea de la Amhon finaliza este miércoles con las conclusiones y los acuerdos con el gobierno central y los organismos internacionales.",

      "translatedDescription": "The paradisiaca Island of Roatán, in the department of islands of the Bay, hosted the 34 Assembly of the Association of Municipalities of Honduras (AMHON), with the participation of the 298 mayors and mayors of the country. The annual meeting of the mayor began on Monday 26 with the registration of the participants. President Xiomara Castro was invited to honor and arrived on Tuesday to the great event that takes place at the facilities of the Apostolic Ministry Vision of the Kingdom. Likewise, Luis Redondo, president of the National Congress, and Rebeca Ráquel Obando, president of the Supreme Court of Justice attended. The objective of the AMHON Assembly is to be able to develop a platform for dialogue and joint action between mayors and mayors, with the central government and international cooperation. One of the moments that most caught the attention of those present was when President Xiomara Castro offered in her speech requested the vote for Rixi Moncada, candidate of the Freedom and Refoundation Party (free) in power. \"For all this to continue I invite you to support the woman who will give continuity to the re -foundation projects, the lawyer Rixi Moncada Godoy,\" said the president of the Hondurans in Roatán. The invitation to vote for Rixi Moncada, who on Tuesday presented his resignation as Minister of Defense for the general elections, was not to the opposition, since they assured that the mayors assembly cannot be politicized. Xiomara Castro also mentioned other country issues, promoting its project for the refounding of the homeland, which must be converted into a daily practice. He stressed that more than 24 billion lempiras have been transferred promptly to municipalities in the last three years and four months of their government management. \"These transfers to municipalities are an expression of the will of my government, from democratic socialism, to decentralize state resources,\" said Xiomara Castro. He emphasized his government's achievements such as school repair, construction of productive roads, rural boxes, road paving, among other projects that are carried out with the municipalities. Castro also highlighted the hiring of five thousand teachers, a free school snack program and the free registration that has restored the right of a free, bilingual and morazanist public education. He also reiterated the construction of eight hospitals nationwide, a child maternal, four neonatal centers and two trauma hospitals in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa Rom Macnab, mayor of Roatán in his status as host, welcomed the mayors of the country. \"Thank you for being here. Thank you for what they do every day from its mayorships. And thanks for believing, like me, that from the local you can transform to Honduras,\" he said. The 34 Assembly of the AMHON ends this Wednesday with the conclusions and agreements with the central government and international organizations.",

      "description": "Docentes y padres de familia de la escuela Christian Academy, en el municipio de Jutiapa, Atlántida, no dan crédito a la repentina muerte de la niña Bianca Galeas (de 7 años) y su padre Jorge Antonio Galeano Osorio (de 55). El doble homicidio ocurrió la tarde del lunes entre las aldeas Cacao y Agua Caliente, frente a la carretera CA-13. De acuerdo con testigos, Jorge Galeano se encontraba dentro de su vehículo tipo pick-up y se disponía a bajarse en una llantera cuando sicarios, a bordo de una motocicleta, se le acercaron y abrieron fuego. Galeano murió en el lugar, mientras que su hija resultó herida por los disparos. Fue trasladada a un centro asistencial, donde se reportó su fallecimiento. En el ataque también resultó herido el dueño de la llantera, quien se encuentra fuera de peligro. Familiares de Jorge Galeano recogieron su cuerpo y lo trasladaron a su vivienda. El cadáver no fue llevado a la morgue de La Ceiba. Según se conoció, Galeano era un conocido ganadero de la zona.​​​​​​ La escuela Christian Academy emitió un acuerdo de duelo lamentando lo sucedido. “Con profundo dolor, la comunidad educativa lamenta el sensible fallecimiento de nuestra amada estudiante de kínder”, expresa el comunicado. La Policía Nacional ha manejado el caso con hermetismo y solo ha brindado información escueta sobre los hechos violentos. “No se hizo levantamiento, ya que cuando la policía llegó ya se habían llevado el cuerpo”, dijo Angelina Galeas, portavoz policial. La tarde del martes, se reportaron otras dos muertes en el municipio de Jutiapa, específicamente en el desvío a La Danta, en la comunidad de Corralitos. Una de las víctimas fue identificada como Wilmer Dubón, mientras que la otra persona no fue reconocida. Las autoridades no confirmaron si este doble crimen está relacionado con el asesinato de Jorge Galeano y su hija. Tampoco se han revelado los móviles de ninguno de los hechos. Durante la Operación Candado, realizada en 2016 en Jutiapa, la Policía capturó a siete personas vinculadas a la banda “Los Galeano”. En esa ocasión, se les decomisó un arsenal de armas de grueso calibre. Entre los detenidos figuraban Jorge Antonio Galeano Osorio y su hermano Andrés de Jesús Galeano. Residentes del sector indicaron que las recientes muertes podrían estar vinculadas a una “limpieza” dentro de la banda, dedicada al asalto a mano armada, robo a repartidores y sicariato. “En otras ocasiones ya se han reportado muertes relacionadas a ellos, así como capturas”, comentaron. Ayer por la tarde también se reportó la incautación de armas de fuego dentro de un vehículo Ford color negro, hecho que podría estar relacionado con los asesinatos en Jutiapa. Sin embargo, la Policía no ha emitido un informe oficial al respecto. En la colonia El Pedregal, de la aldea Sambo Creek, en La Ceiba, sujetos armados ingresaron a la vivienda de José Alfredo Navarro, de 46 años, y le dispararon hasta quitarle la vida. El hecho ocurrió alrededor de las 9:00 pm del lunes. Navarro era originario de Jutiapa. En la escena del crimen se decomisaron dos teléfonos celulares, los cuales serán analizados para determinar si el asesinato guarda relación con los hechos violentos ocurridos en Jutiapa. “Los dos teléfonos que se levantaron van a estar siendo vaciados para determinar si están ligados a otras muertes. Por ahora se maneja enemistades personales”, informó Angelina Galeas, portavoz policial.

      "description": "La audiencia para presentar pruebas contra Francia Sofía Medina, fiscal acusada de sustraer 88 millones de lempiras del Banco Central de Honduras (BCH), sigue pendiente, ya que el tribunal aún no ha fijado una fecha. Las autoridades del Ministerio Público (MP) informaron que la investigación sigue abierta contra empleados del BCH que entregaron el dinero a Medina sin cumplir con los requisitos legales. También se investiga a dos de los cinco fiscales inicialmente señalados por su supuesta participación en la desaparición del dinero, el cual estaba bajo resguardo como evidencia en casos en curso del Ministerio Público. Medina fue capturada el 30 de noviembre de 2023 en su residencia en San Pedro Sula, luego de que el MP identificara supuestas irregularidades cometidas por la acusadora pública. Según el MP, los 42 delitos que se le imputan ya cuentan con pruebas documentales. De ser hallada culpable en juicio oral y público, enfrentaría una condena mínima de 40 años de prisión. Entre los delitos señalados figuran: lavado de activos, enriquecimiento ilícito, uso de información privilegiada, ocultación y destrucción de evidencias, así como 38 cargos por falsificación de documentos públicos. Las investigaciones indican que la fiscal realizó 38 retiros del BCH, sumando 88 millones de lempiras, sin seguir los procedimientos establecidos por el MP. Desde 2021, Medina habría empezado a retirar fondos sin cumplir con los protocolos que exigen una autorización secuencial del fiscal del caso, del coordinador, y del subdirector, previo a la entrega en el banco. El caso salió a la luz luego de que los apoderados legales de una paleontóloga, a quien le habían decomisado 63,000 dólares, reclamaran la devolución del dinero. El BCH respondió que ya había sido entregado, lo que motivó al MP a solicitar un informe. La institución financiera informó entonces que se habían retirado 88 millones de lempiras que figuraban como evidencia. El MP sostiene que el BCH tenía responsabilidad jurídica sobre esos fondos y actuaba como garante. El 4 de diciembre de 2023, un juez emitió orden de captura contra Germán René Silva, pareja de la fiscal Medina y también fiscal, quien se encuentra prófugo. Según la Agencia Técnica de Investigación Criminal (ATIC), hay indicios de su participación en el delito. Ese mismo día, el MP aseguró 36 bienes propiedad de Francia Medina en los departamentos de Comayagua y Cortés, incluyendo siete inmuebles, 20 vehículos y nueve cuentas bancarias.",

      "translatedDescription": "The hearing to present evidence against France Sofía Medina, prosecutor accused of subtracting 88 million lempiras from the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), is still pending, since the court has not yet set a date. The authorities of the Public Ministry (MP) reported that the investigation is still open against BCH employees who delivered the money to Medina without complying with the legal requirements. Two of the five prosecutors are also investigated initially indicated for their alleged participation in the disappearance of money, which was under shelter as evidence in cases of the Public Ministry. Medina was captured on November 30, 2023 at its residence in San Pedro Sula, after the MP identified alleged irregularities committed by the public prosecutor. According to the MP, the 42 crimes that are already charged with documentary evidence. If they were found guilty in oral and public trial, it would face a minimum sentence of 40 years in prison. Among the crimes indicated are: money laundering, illicit enrichment, use of privileged information, concealment and destruction of evidence, as well as 38 positions for falsification of public documents. The investigations indicate that the prosecutor made 38 withdrawals from the BCH, adding 88 million lempiras, without following the procedures established by the MP. Since 2021, Medina would have begun to withdraw funds without complying with the protocols that require a sequential authorization of the case prosecutor, the coordinator, and the deputy director, prior to the delivery in the bank. The case came to light after the legal proxies of a paleontologist, who had seized $ 63,000, claimed the return of money. The BCH replied that it had already been delivered, which motivated the MP to request a report. The financial institution then reported that 88 million lempiras had been withdrawn that were evidence. The MP argues that the BCH had legal responsibility on those funds and acted as guarantor. On December 4, 2023, a judge issued a arrest warrant against Germán René Silva, a couple of prosecutor Medina and also a fiscal, who is a fugitive. According to the Technical Agency for Criminal Investigation (ATIC), there are indications of their participation in the crime. That same day, the MP assured 36 goods owned by France Medina in the departments of Comayagua and Cortés, including seven properties, 20 vehicles and nine bank accounts.",

La moción respaldada por alrededor de 74 diputados, señala que la Ley del Poder Legislativo, en su artículo 67, permite presentar mociones de orden previas a cualquier asunto en discusión. El documento, que incluye las firmas de los legisladores que apoyan la moción, denuncia que el oficialismo ha estado usando las sesiones para \"dar largas\" y confundir a la opinión pública, con el fin de ganar tiempo y proteger intereses políticos. La oposición refiere que la transparencia y la celeridad en la discusión del acta son esenciales para fortalecer la democracia en el país. A su vez, argumentan que la moción en mención cumple con todos los requisitos para ser considerada como prioritaria.",

The document, which includes the signatures of the legislators who support the motion, denounces that the ruling has been using the sessions to \"give long\" and confuse public opinion, in order to gain time and protect political interests. The opposition says that transparency and speed in the discussion of the act are essential to strengthen democracy in the country.

      "description": "DR JAMELIA HARRIS OFTENTIMES those who critique the current state of development in TT look to the North or Far East with aspirational eyes. Why can't we be like Canada? Like Germany? Like Singapore? If we assess the debates around the property tax and the impending repeal of the Property Tax Act, we will find some answers. The first, and most obvious, is that most developed countries have a property tax. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development notes that across all of Europe only two countries do not levy property tax: Liechtenstein and Malta. There are over 40 countries in Europe. The reason for property taxes being so commonplace is simple: they offer a reliable and stable source of government revenue. The fiscal arguments are clear. The economic arguments are also clear. From an economic perspective, of all possible taxes, a property tax is least distortionary as it has the least impact on behaviour – a higher property tax is unlikely to cause someone to sell their home. The main challenge of the property tax is that it requires political will and public buy-in – as we have clearly seen here in TT. The second lesson is that we have a very low appetite for paying taxes – lower than in most developed countries. In all developed countries the social contract is such that citizens pay taxes; sometimes up to 12 per cent in property tax and 40 per cent in income tax if we use the UK as an example. That said, the UK does not have the highest tax rates in Europe or globally. The residential rate of the property tax in TT is two per cent, reduced from three per cent. The understanding in most developed countries is that to fund public goods and services taxes must be paid. This social contract is not very strong in TT. There are multiple reasons for the breakdown of this social contract – top of the list are corruption and mismanagement. Also on this list is the belief by some citizens of their right to public goods and services, but not their responsibility for paying into the collective pot. The third is that we are not serious about diversifying our tax base. We have been having the diversification conservation for most of our existence as an independent country. One of the benefits of a diversified economy is a diversified tax base so that the government is not overly dependent on any one tax source. Beyond diversifying the economy, the government can directly diversify the tax base to ensure multiple tax sources can be tapped into. This is what developed countries do. This is what the property tax was intended to do. The fourth is that we are a society with poor enforcement of laws. We see this daily. With the property tax, a large share of residents did not pay the tax. The consequences: nothing. In most developed countries, non-payment of tax is met with a warning, a fine, and, at worse, prison time. And fifth, and possibly most concerning, we do not reward playing by the rules. In contrast to the group that did not pay, the other share of the population duly complied with the law and paid their taxes. Finance Minister Davendranath Tancoo promised a refund; which the Prime Minister swiftly refuted. Kamla Persad-Bissessar's response: we told them not to pay, reflecting on her position as then-opposition leader. In other words, you should have refused to comply with the law. Such advice would rarely come from one of the highest offices in the average developed country, far less from a seasoned lawyer. We really need to look in the mirror in TT. We want to be more developed. We want progress. But progress requires change. Let's change our tax base and introduce the property tax. No thank you. Let's change our revenue collection system and collect revenues more efficiently with the TT Revenue Authority. No thank you. Let's change our driving behaviour with the demerit points system. No thank you. If the only thing we are willing to change is our government, and not the underlying structures of our economy, fiscal system and society, then we will change little and our quest for continued development will be elusive.

      "description": "FROM ALL sides, pressure is mounting on Venezuelan migrants. In the US, the Supreme Court on May 19 allowed the Trump administration to strip at least 340,000 of temporary protected status, reportedly the largest such dismantling of amnesty in modern American history. The humanitarian crisis these people have fled – characterised by widespread hunger and malnutrition, the rise of armed gangs, crumbling infrastructure and deep political repression – has only worsened. On May 25, the Nicolas Maduro regime claimed victory in regional and legislative elections, compounding the fraudulence of last year’s widely discredited presidential poll. In TT, thousands of Venezuelans today face deep uncertainty. The April 28 general election result has done little to clarify their fate. The PNM government, which had at one stage allowed at least 35,300 to live and work here under a renewable permit scheme, under Stuart Young agreed to co-operate with Trump administration officials’ efforts to tackle the so-called threat of the Tren de Aragua gang, an invasive threat used to justify the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. But the US intelligence community, in a declassified memo published in the American press on May 5, assessed the gang to have no ties with the Maduro regime. The newly elected UNC administration, meanwhile, is yet to address robustly the future of the Venezuelan migrant scheme amid a rising tide of rhetoric against migrants. Yet, deafening silence will soon become unsustainable given the prospect of a full-blown conflagration. In an interview with this newspaper on May 20, Dr Anthony Gonzales, the former head of the Institute for International Relations at UWI, St Augustine, noted the Supreme Court ruling alone will pile more pressure on TT. “It is a cause for concern,” he said. “Venezuela is not in a good position to receive these deportees.” This country’s treatment of migrants is not just an economic issue. Nor is it just a political one. It is an ethical issue that demands a strong moral compass. Unfortunately, that clarity has been lacking in the years since 2015, even as the total number of people fleeing our closest neighbour has risen to at least 7.9 million in one of the largest humanitarian displacements the world has ever seen. The state dragged its feet with the admission of thousands of children into schools; some were killed during reckless refoulement activities in open seas. The economic advantages generated by a supplemented workforce have been conveniently ignored. Venezuelan migrants have been broadly brushed as criminals, even as some continue to succumb to local crime. But soon, with this crisis deepening, officials might have little choice but to come face to face with the moral implications of their own policymaking, or lack thereof.

      "description": "THE EDITOR: For decades, the decentralisation of government offices has been widely discussed, but meaningful progress has yet to be made. It is time to move beyond talk and take decisive action to make this long-overdue transition a reality. Relocating government offices out of Port of Spain offers clear advantages for the nation. Rental costs in outlying areas are significantly lower, which will mean substantial savings for the state. It would also help ease the severe traffic congestion faced by thousands of commuters daily, reducing stress and improving the overall quality of life. A less congested Port of Spain would result in better air quality, improved mobility, and a more inviting environment for tourism and leisure activities. Overall, these changes would enhance the city’s appeal and benefit public health. Decentralisation also provides an important opportunity to stimulate economic growth in less developed areas. Encouraging investment, creating jobs, and improving infrastructure outside the capital city would promote balanced regional development. At the May 22 post-Cabinet media briefing, the Prime Minister highlighted the high cost of government rentals, many of which operate under expired leases and lack proper fire, health, and safety certifications. This situation underscores the urgent need for stronger oversight and a thorough review of rental agreements. Moreover, discussions about rent control should not be confined solely to government leases. The discussions must also extend to the private rental market to protect vulnerable citizens from exploitative and unsafe living or working conditions. Additionally, the expansion of remote work and the acceleration of public service digitisation offer practical, forward-looking solutions to reduce the government’s reliance on physical office space. These strategies can significantly lower operational costs while enhancing efficiency, flexibility, and convenience for both public servants and the citizens they serve. The rationale for decentralisation is both clear and compelling. What is required now is the political will and steadfast commitment to implementation – qualities I am confident this new administration will demonstrate in due course.

This rubber hits the road, feet on the ground, walking the factory managerial and leadership style should not only be encouraged, but also implemented by all his ministerial peers. Zakour has taken an unprecedented stance by refusing to use his entitled Priority Bus Route (PBR) pass. He argues that by experiencing the roadways and traffic as an ordinary citizen he can better understand, address and correctly steward his role. Unfortunately, the mandate to serve us, the people, is lost on many of our elected and appointed leaders today. Many live lives very distinct from those whom their decisions directly impact. They are shielded and isolated from the consequences (and sometimes nuisances) that their policies, actions or inactions create. No reasonable person believed the former prime minister tightened his belt in the same way he expected us to, nor did anyone believe for a second that Colm Imbert was “vex with himself” regarding the increasing fuel costs. But Zakour says that his tenure of service will be different. That he will acquaint himself with the same experience on the roadways as the average driver. And simply put, I'm all for it. Now we’ll have someone in a position to enact change experiencing the rote morning creep towards the capital. This may lead them to support work-from-home legislation. Now they, too, can feel the danger of the westbound rightmost lane being abruptly halved at every stop; from Tacarigua to St Augustine. Leading them to enquire why the turning-lane traffic signal isn't lengthened at pick-up and drop-off times. Now they can join us in the defensive driving required to avoid the many potholes that riddle our nation's roads. Urging them to offer aid or help streamline the repair work that the boroughs and counties do. Maybe, just maybe, when those in positions to enact change experience the same delays, inconveniences and lacklustre customer service, then we can see real positive and lasting change taking place. So go ahead, minister, because it sounds good to me. Keep left, except when overtaking, tune in to your favourite talk show, lean back and get comfortable, because it's gonna be a long ride.

      "title": "Investigations ongoing – More SoE charges possible",
      "description": "Police say more charges are possible as a result of investigations launched against people arrested during the state of emergency (SoE). The SoE, which began on December 30 and ended on April 13, saw 50 people detained under the authority of a Preventive Detention Order. Of that number, 14 people who police said are affiliated with two particular gangs, were charged with multiple gang-related offences. Despite the release of the remaining 34, police have always maintained investigations are continuing and they can be charged at a later date. At the police media briefing on May 27, TTPS legal officer Cpl Zaheer Ali said the investigations “have progressed evidentially.” Asked for an update on the possibility of more people being charged, Ali said, “In some instances, those investigative files are engaging the legal officers in the TTPS.” “And in some instances, consultations are ongoing with the Director of Public Prosecutions, so I anticipate that in the near future and within a reasonable time, our commissioner will be able to respond as to whether in fact those cases have matured to attract prosecutions.” Ali said police have been “thinking out of the box” to address the challenges they faced in completing the investigations. “We are exploring the law and we have made some progress. When you are dealing with organised crime and gang investigations, those are complex matters. And when you are heavily dependent on witnesses to come forward, it definitely will create a challenge.” Acting Police Commissioner Junior Benjamin said police are pleased with crime statistics this year in comparison to previous years, describing it as a small win. He noted there has been a year-on-year reduction in violent crimes including murders. There were 228 murders between January 1 and May 27, 2024 compared to 153 for the same period this year. This is an even further decrease from the 242, during that same period, in 2023. “When we look at our murders we have at least a 33 per cent reduction, against that of last year. When we look at our violent crimes in 2024 we had, 1991 reports. Now in 2025 we have only 1424 reports. That is a 28 per cent reduction.” Breaking the figure down by month, Benjamin said there have been 23 murders in May compared to 52 murders in May 2024, and 49 in May 2023. He attributed the decline to the hard work of the police. “We are not just seeing a reduction in murders, but also a reduction in terms of woundings and shootings. “In 2024, we had 297, in 2025 we have 210. We are also seeing a reduction in terms of sexual offences with 338 reports in 2024, and 330 in 2025.” He said police are grateful for the “positive change,” and added Port of Spain, Tobago and North Central divisions have had the highest murder rate reduction with 68, 69 and 70 per cent, respectively. Benjamin said despite these gains, police are still not satisfied and urged the public to join them in the fight against crime to ensure any progress made, is not lost.

      "translatedTitle": "Investigations ongoing – More SoE charges possible",
      "translatedDescription": "Police say more charges are possible as a result of investigations launched against people arrested during the state of emergency (SoE). The SoE, which began on December 30 and ended on April 13, saw 50 people detained under the authority of a Preventive Detention Order. Of that number, 14 people who police said are affiliated with two particular gangs, were charged with multiple gang-related offences. Despite the release of the remaining 34, police have always maintained investigations are continuing and they can be charged at a later date. At the police media briefing on May 27, TTPS legal officer Cpl Zaheer Ali said the investigations “have progressed evidentially.” Asked for an update on the possibility of more people being charged, Ali said, “In some instances, those investigative files are engaging the legal officers in the TTPS.” “And in some instances, consultations are ongoing with the Director of Public Prosecutions, so I anticipate that in the near future and within a reasonable time, our commissioner will be able to respond as to whether in fact those cases have matured to attract prosecutions.” Ali said police have been “thinking out of the box” to address the challenges they faced in completing the investigations. “We are exploring the law and we have made some progress. When you are dealing with organised crime and gang investigations, those are complex matters. And when you are heavily dependent on witnesses to come forward, it definitely will create a challenge.” Acting Police Commissioner Junior Benjamin said police are pleased with crime statistics this year in comparison to previous years, describing it as a small win. He noted there has been a year-on-year reduction in violent crimes including murders. There were 228 murders between January 1 and May 27, 2024 compared to 153 for the same period this year. This is an even further decrease from the 242, during that same period, in 2023. “When we look at our murders we have at least a 33 per cent reduction, against that of last year. When we look at our violent crimes in 2024 we had, 1991 reports. Now in 2025 we have only 1424 reports. That is a 28 per cent reduction.” Breaking the figure down by month, Benjamin said there have been 23 murders in May compared to 52 murders in May 2024, and 49 in May 2023. He attributed the decline to the hard work of the police. “We are not just seeing a reduction in murders, but also a reduction in terms of woundings and shootings. “In 2024, we had 297, in 2025 we have 210. We are also seeing a reduction in terms of sexual offences with 338 reports in 2024, and 330 in 2025.” He said police are grateful for the “positive change,” and added Port of Spain, Tobago and North Central divisions have had the highest murder rate reduction with 68, 69 and 70 per cent, respectively.

Sampson resigned from the post after being elected MP for Tobago West. He was also the electoral representative for the Crown Point/Bon Accord district. Sampson won his seat in the April 28 general election on a Tobago People’s Party (TPP) ticket, securing the constituency with a total of 6,713 votes, 109 votes more than PNM's Shamfa Cudjoe-Lewis.

He said the replacement had already been identified but noted that the name will not be disclosed until all legal formalities are completed. Augustine said there will be no by-election in the Crown Point/Bon Accord district as the vacancy arose within one year of THA elections, which are constitutionally due in 2025. Newsday tried to contact Augustine for an update on the new secretary, but all calls and messages were unanswered on May 27.

      "description": "West Indies’ journey towards securing automatic qualification to the 2027 Cricket World Cup (ODI) resumes with a three-match series against hosts England, set to bowl off at Edgbaston Stadium in Birmingham on May 29, from 8 am (TT time). Fresh off a 1-1 ODI series draw against Ireland last week, the Windies remain in pursuit of their first series win for 2025. West Indies (81 pts) are currently ninth on the ICC men’s ODI rankings, three points behind England, in eighth. Only the top eight teams by March 31, 2027, earn an automatic Cricket World Cup spot. Despite being ninth, West Indies remain among the automatic qualifiers since sixth-ranked South Africa have already secured their spot as co-hosts. However, an away series win for the Windies would propel them beyond England, and possibly past seventh-ranked Afghanistan. Speaking after an intense indoor session in England on May 27, head coach Daren Sammy said, “Ever since we started this journey with World Cup 2027 in mind, automatic qualification is the first goal. Climbing the rankings is the only way we can do that. Every ODI game from now until the qualification deadline is important. That should be extra incentive for our guys.” Despite wet conditions affecting their preparation in Birmingham, Sammy commended the squad for their attitude and commitment, noting that the indoor sessions made up for the loss of turf practice. “That’s the type of attitude you want from your men. To see the guys come in here and continue to work on specific skillsets that we’re trying to improve on, it was really good to watch. That’s the type of culture we set out to have in the ODI team, and it’s good to see guys buying into it.” The coach acknowledged the challenge of facing England on their home turf, but remained confident in the squad’s ability to rise to the occasion. “Every international team poses different types of challenges. We hold the trophy from winning the series at home and we’re trying to better our away record. We have a team capable of doing that.” One of the key positives in West Indies’ recent form has been their batting—particularly a surge in centuries and the emergence of a solid middle order. The team has recorded eight centuries in their last ten ODIs. “Keacy Carty is a prime example of hard work paying off,” Sammy said. “The role we’ve given him, he’s grabbed it and made the best out of it. When you make an investment you don’t expect high returns so quickly. Keacy has defied the odds, and long may that continue.” Carty was West Indies’ shining light with the bat against Ireland recently, slamming 102 in the second ODI, which ended in a no result because of rain, and then a masterful 170 in the final match, which the Windies won to level the series.  Sammy also highlighted the growing strength of West Indies’ bowling attack, particularly the impact of pace bowler Jayden Seales with the new ball. “The batting has been really good for us over the last year. Now it’s for us to do that away from home. And our bowling, especially with Jayden Seales, is improving too.” As the countdown to the series opener continues, Sammy insists the team will be ready—rain or shine. “We are preparing well with the conditions that are handed to us, and we will be ready by the time we play England, weather permitting.” The ODI series will take place on May 29, June 1 and June 3. A three-match T20 series follows between the two nations from June 6-10. The post Windies coach: England series key to World Cup qualification appeared first on Trinidad and Tobago Newsday .",

      "description": "Dil-E-Nadan frontline artiste, Stephen Marcelle, fresh off a Florida circuit run with the band is set to release new new music as he prepares for tours in South Africa and Canada. “I have a new song called, Happy Birthday that I’m getting ready to release. It was written by Nyce Nation and produced by Feel Good Music.” Marcelle says he felt the need to do a song that could be requested at any time of the year and would suit the celebratory birthday vibe. “It’s an R&B groove and it’s universal,” he said, in a media release. Happy to be home for the moment, Marcelle says he won’t be in Trinidad and Tobago for long as Dil-E-Nadan will head to Amsterdam, followed by South Africa in June. “It’s nine hours from Port of Spain to Amsterdam and ten-12 hours from Amsterdam to South Africa,” he said, explaining that he does not sleep while in the air, and often chooses to write new music. With two songs already prepared for next year’s Carnival, Marcelle explains that like most artistes, he immediately gets back to work on new music once the season in TT has ended. “I have these two chutney soca tracks already done and I’m working on my soca and calypso tracks for 2026.” Amid the hard work in studio, Marcelle balances performances and travel while he continues to work dedicatedly at his craft, all while maintaining his focus on his advanced academic pursuits, the release said. On May 29, he will perform at Naparima Bowl for Kaiso Jazz alongside other artistes like Kay Alleyne and Terri Lyons. On July 5, he will join a dynamic cast of calypsonians at CLR Auditorium for the Who Am I tribute concert to Sugar Aloes. The band then heads out to New Jersey and New York, followed by Canada in August. With new culture and arts minister installed Marcelle says he is hopeful that the new administration will support all aspects of TT’s culture and the creatives who carry the flag, the release said. “My hope for the culture in TT, it’s development and international recognition, lies in the support of the new minister and the new administration. I think it’s really important for the government to fuel calypso music’s marketing internationally, in particular. People from all walks of life respond so well to calypso music outside of TT and outside of our traditional communities. I think it’s really worth investing in all arms of our culture.” New music on the way, Marcelle plans on engaging other artistes for collaborations in the season ahead and is steadfast in his mission to become more of a household name across the Caribbean region.

      "description": "THE latest in what has been a series of criminal acts against a San Fernando businessman and his family ended in murder, when an employee of the businessman was shot dead while in his car which was stuck in early afternoon traffic in San Fernando on May 27. The victim, Salim Abdool, 21, of La Romain was employed by Shane Maharaj of SNM Motors Ltd. Maharaj is the son of Rabindranath Maharaj, owner of R&J Cell Tech. The family has been the target of criminals over the years, with three incidents taking place within the past two weeks. Police said that around 1.20 pm, Abdool was driving Maharaj's white Toyota Hilux GR van which was caught in standstill traffic along the Golconda Connector Road, Union Hall, San Fernando near VMCOTT. A vehicle approached the side of Maharaj's van and the occupants opened fire, hitting Abdool in the chest. Other motorists reported hearing three gunshots. Abdool lost control of the pick-up which crashed into a brand new, unlicensed Mercedes-Benz which was being driven by Shane Maharaj. Cellphone video recordings uploaded to social media showed Maharaj opening the Hilux door shortly after the attack and holding his head in apparent panic. Abdool was taken to the San Fernando General Hospital via ambulance but died shortly after. President of the Greater San Fernando Area Chamber of Commerce Kiran Singh extended condolences to Abdool's family. He questioned how criminals are gaining access to illegal firearms and called on national security authorities to give a timeline for installing CCTV cameras at traffic lights, which could help investigations into such incidents. When Newsday reached out to Shane Maharaj, he immediately terminated the call. His father, Rabindranath, said the family was not willing to speak to the press at this time as police were conducting investigations. Maharaj's sister Lisa, narrowly escaped death in a similar attack that happened exactly two weeks ago. She was driving her white Range Rover along the South Trunk Road in La Romain around 10 am on May 13, when a white Nissan B-14 rammed into the back of her SUV near Achievor's Banquet Hall. A gunman jumped out of the passenger side of the B-14 and shot at the woman twice before going back into the car which sped off. Following the May 13 incident, family members said that they had been targeted several times before, with a relative being kidnapped, two attempted kidnappings on another relative, and they and their businesses being robbed 14 times. Following the May 13 attack, Assistant Commissioner of Police Wayne Mystar pledged to use every resource at the police's disposal to track down the suspects. Newsday was unable to reach Mystar on May 27, for an update on investigations into the shooting of Lisa, and the murder of Abdool. Adding to attacks against the family, Newsday understands that gunmen also opened fire on a vehicle belonging to the boyfriend of a member of the Maharaj family. This incident is said to have taken place on May 23. Checks with police late on May 27 revealed no arrests had been made into the murder of Abdool, whose body has since been taken to the Forensic Sciences Centre in St James for autopsy.

      "description": "On a rain-drenched day intermittently brightened by fleeting sunlight, Minister of Rural Development and Local Government Khadijah Ameen, speaking with media in front of City Hall, Port of Spain, on May 27, reaffirmed the government's commitment to a national, multi-agency flood mitigation strategy. Flanked by Public Services Association (PSA) president Felisha Thomas and deputy Mayor Abena Hartley, Ameen stressed the need for co-ordinated, cross-sector action to address both the underlying causes and immediate impacts of flooding across the country’s regional corporations. Fresh from a site visit to the Diego Martin Regional Corporation earlier, Ameen said the government is blending emergency responses with long-term infrastructure solutions. “It is my intention that as the flood mitigation programme unfolds in every region, we remain committed. We have deployed additional equipment and manpower to the most affected areas. We are taking a holistic approach.” She issued a firm call to action for corporation heads: “It is no longer acceptable for corporations to deflect responsibility, claiming certain areas fall under the Ministry of Works or Agriculture. This requires all hands on deck.” During her Diego Martin tour, Ameen said her team identified areas where significantly more could be done and pledged to work closely with regional leadership to explore engineering solutions and consult stakeholders. In San Juan/Laventille, home to flood-prone areas such as Aranguez and El Socorro, she said her ministry has already dispatched equipment and is actively identifying practical interventions. “Each corporation is expected to prioritise their most vulnerable communities. Where engineering input is needed, we are collaborating with technical experts on project proposals.” Beyond flood management, Ameen said she is also addressing longstanding issues in local government workplaces. Saying she met with municipal officers and PSA representatives to discuss the unacceptable conditions workers are forced to work under. “Cramped spaces, outdated infrastructure, broken air-conditioning, mould, and leaks – some staff are literally sharing chairs. This is not an environment that fosters productivity.” She criticised the former administration for failing to provide adequate support to local government bodies. “Reforms cannot be about stripping workers of their rights and then blaming them for low performance. That’s not governance: that’s abdication of responsibility.” In contrast, Ameen said the current administration is committed to a more inclusive, hands-on approach, one that prioritises both infrastructure and the people behind it. “We’ve been forced to work with limited resources, but we’re making it work through better planning, stronger leadership, and the support of volunteers.” She directly accused the PNM of allowing key watercourses, including the Caroni River, to fall into disrepair due to years of neglect. “We cannot undo eight or ten years of mismanagement in two months. But we must fix what we can now.” Ameen said a \"comprehensive flood-control plan\" was submitted to cabinet, outlining upgrades to floodgates, pumps, and riverbank reinforcements. “This is about more than engineering; it’s about political will.” Port of Spain, she noted, is receiving special attention due to its vulnerability as a coastal city. When asked whether she had the support of Port of Spain Mayor Chinua Alleyne, Ameen avoided direct comment but stressed the importance of non-partisan co-operation. “We are rotating equipment and manpower where it’s needed most.” She said all ongoing efforts have been executed without additional government funding. “We’ve been operating with existing resources, allocating them more strategically. This shows what can be accomplished with competent leadership and efficient management.” Regarding future funding, Ameen said assessments are ongoing, and top-priority projects will be integrated into the upcoming budget cycle. Wearing all-weather gear on her visits, she underscored the value of ground-level engagement. “We’re not standing on dry land, watching from a distance. We’re going into the most affected areas, those that flood year after year, and finding specific, evidence-based solutions.” While many problems stem from neglected maintenance, she acknowledged that some areas require more advanced engineering fixes. Echoing Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar's prior statements on the economy, Ameen again blamed the previous government for underfunding both the ministry and regional corporations while reiterating her commitment to working with all local bodies to upgrade drainage infrastructure. Thomas said she was present on behalf of municipal workers, many of whom have raised serious health and safety concerns in recent weeks. “Beyond health and safety, municipal officers face unresolved issues around pay, job descriptions, and basic operational needs.” Thomas described dilapidated buildings, unsafe firearm storage, vehicle shortages, and offices doubling as construction zones. She credited Ameen with wanting to understand the issues firsthand. “Officers had tried resolving these issues internally, but roadblocks persisted. Eventually, they had no choice but to bring them to the PSA.” Following the press conference, Ameen and her team toured the City Police Department. The automatic door was broken, foul odours lingered throughout the facility, and essential equipment, including shelving and chairs was visibly deteriorating.

      "title": "2002 shooting case collapses: Alexander, 3 cops discredited",
      "description": "THE TESTIMONY of four policemen – including Minister of Homeland Security Roger Alexander – in a case of a man who was charged with shooting at police over 20 years ago, has been discredited by a judge who delivered his verdict in the case on May 27 As a result, Charford Court, Port of Spain resident Ken Foster walked free after the judge dismissed the evidence of Alexander and the three officers, as well as the evidence of a police photographer, in the judge-only trial. Foster was charged with shooting with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to officers Roger Alexander, Phillip Forbes, Andrew Lawrence and Victor Graham on April 3, 2002, along with illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Alexander resigned from the police service at the rank of senior superintendent, subsequently joined the UNC and was elected Tunapuna MP in the April 28 general election. He was appointed Minister of Homeland Security when the ministry of national security was split into two entities, with the other being the Ministry of Defence, led by Sangre Grande MP Wayne Sturge. During the judge-only trial which began in March, Justice Hayden St Clair-Douglas heard testimony from the four officers and the police photographer. The prosecution claimed the four officers who at the time were assigned to North Eastern Division Task Force in Morvant, were on patrol when they received a report of a stolen Nissan B14. They allegedly spotted the car in Belmont and gave chase to Lady Young Road, where the four claimed Foster, the sole passenger, opened fire on them near Jusamco Quarry. The chase continued to the walkover along the Lady Young Road, when it was alleged Foster again shot at the officers, resulting in Alexander returning fire and shooting Foster in the buttocks. Prosecutors contended that Foster acted brazenly and Alexander had no choice but to react. Foster was also accused of jumping on the “police too wicked” bandwagon, in his defence, by alleging that the officers “set me up.” St Clair-Douglas was asked to disregard what was nothing more than a “smokescreen” by Foster to disguise his actions 23 years ago. Foster’s attorney Peter Carter said the prosecution’s case was riddled with holes as he challenged the integrity of the case. Although Foster did not testify, his defence centred on a flat denial of the allegations. He also claimed that officers attempted to pressure him into falsely identifying Kerwin \"Fresh\" Phillip, one-time leader of the G-Unit Gang as the passenger of the car, and he was only charged because he refused and the police were unable to set Phillip up with a case. Phillip was gunned down in 2007. Carter highlighted serious discrepancies in the officers' testimonies, procedural failures, and apparent mishandling of evidence. He pointed to the lack of any immediate crime scene processing, the absence of a contemporaneous police station diary entry, signs of possible collusion in the officers' written statements, and inconsistencies in the chain of custody for the gun and spent shell casings. In delivering his verdict during a virtual hearing, St Clair-Douglas gave detailed reasons for his ruling, noting the contradictions in the officers’ accounts and unresolved concerns about potential evidence tampering. Specifically, he flagged unexplained changes in the markings on the shells and the firearm and said the State had not satisfactorily addressed those issues. “These discrepancies leave the court in doubt,” the judge said. “Looking at the evidence as a whole, I am not sure the accused shot at anyone. I am not sure he was in possession of a firearm or ammunition.” Declaring Foster not guilty, St Clair-Douglas formally discharged him and told him he was free to go. The state was represented by prosecutor Tricia Samuel. The post 2002 shooting case collapses: Alexander, 3 cops discredited appeared first on Trinidad and Tobago Newsday .",

He also claimed that officers attempted to pressure him into falsely identifying Kerwin \"Fresh\" Phillip, one-time leader of the G-Unit Gang as the passenger of the car, and he was only charged because he refused and the police were unable to set Phillip up with a case. Phillip was gunned down in 2007. Carter highlighted serious discrepancies in the officers' testimonies, procedural failures, and apparent mishandling of evidence. He pointed to the lack of any immediate crime scene processing, the absence of a contemporaneous police station diary entry, signs of possible collusion in the officers' written statements, and inconsistencies in the chain of custody for the gun and spent shell casings. In delivering his verdict during a virtual hearing, St Clair-Douglas gave detailed reasons for his ruling, noting the contradictions in the officers’ accounts and unresolved concerns about potential evidence tampering. Specifically, he flagged unexplained changes in the markings on the shells and the firearm and said the State had not satisfactorily addressed those issues. “These discrepancies leave the court in doubt,” the judge said. “Looking at the evidence as a whole, I am not sure the accused shot at anyone. I am not sure he was in possession of a firearm or ammunition.” Declaring Foster not guilty, St Clair-Douglas formally discharged him and told him he was free to go. The state was represented by prosecutor Tricia Samuel. The post 2002 shooting case collapses: Alexander, 3 cops discredited appeared first on Trinidad and Tobago Newsday .",

      "description": "HEALTHCARE services nationwide are set for major upgrades as the Ministry of Health moves to tackle longstanding issues in accessibility and patient care. Among the plans: longer opening hours at health centres, an expanded Chronic Disease Assistance Programme (CDAP), and the long-anticipated operationalisation of the Couva Children’s Hospital. Minister of Health Dr Lackram Bodoe outlined these priorities as he delivered the feature address at the U Health and Wellness Expo at the Hyatt Regency, Port of Spain, on Tuesday May 27. He said the ministry is pressing ahead with a food labelling policy to clearly advise consumers when products are high in sugar, salt and unhealthy fats – part of a broader national strategy to address rising rates of childhood obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). “This event arrives at a time when our nation and indeed the world are grappling with a dual epidemic: the rise of non-communicable diseases and alarming rates of childhood obesity,” Bodoe told the audience. He said government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar, has made addressing these issues a national priority. “Our government intends to explore front-of-package labelling…we must give our families and young people the information they need to make healthier choices because informed choices save lives.” Health centres will soon offer extended operating hours and will be open on Saturdays to improve access to both clinical and preventative care, the minister announced. “We recognise that prevention is better than cure. This is why we are committed to reintroducing extended opening hours at health centres thereby increasing accessibility to preventative healthcare services,” he said. Turning to infrastructure, Bodoe confirmed plans to open the long-delayed Couva Children’s Hospital are moving ahead. In closing his address, he called on young people to embrace healthier lifestyles and make full use of the opportunities presented by health expos like U Health and Wellness. “To the students and youth here today: you are not just the audience of this expo – you are its reason. Take full advantage of this opportunity. Ask questions. Explore ideas. Discover the power you have to take charge of your own health and influence your families, schools and communities for the better,” he urged. After the event, Bodoe told reporters that he had recently toured the children's hospital along with a ministerial team to assess the conditions.  “Everyone seems to be excited about the opening of the Couva Children’s Hospital,” Bodoe said. “As you will remember, it is a 220-bed facility. A preliminary tour was done by myself and a team from the ministry two weeks ago, and that really was to do a status report.” This visit was to verify the hospital’s current assets and identify any gaps before the hospital could become operational. A report has since been submitted to the PM for review. “The prime minister and government will determine how the Couva Hospital will be rolled out in terms of providing services, but we give the assurance it will be opened.” Addressing challenges within the health sector, Bodoe admitted his immediate concerns include longstanding financial issues and public frustration with delays in healthcare services. “I haven’t crossed a month as yet, but my key concerns would be the outstanding debts at the ministry, especially to suppliers – one of the key things,” he said, adding that while he did not have the exact figures on hand, he believes the debt stands at around $400 million. “I’m also concerned with…whether over the last ten years, the $8 billion spent in the health sector provided value for money. My biggest concern as minister is that we’ve had complaints from citizens about access to timely healthcare, long waiting times, both in casualty and for surgeries. Those are things we’re trying to address in the very short term,” Bodoe added. Bodoe announced that the CDAP programme would be expanded, with an increase in both the quantity and quality of medication available to the public.

      "description": "A regulatory body would be among recommendations made by the Scrap Iron Dealers Association to Minister of Trade, Investment and Tourism Kama Maharaj on May 28. This followed a meeting at Nicholas Towers, Port of Spain on May 27. The association’s president Allan Ferguson assured, however, that changes to the scrap metal legislation were imminent. The industry faced issues of private and public theft and was shut for about a year in 2022 because of this. It was reopened in 2023. Ferguson spoke to the media after the almost 45-minute meeting. He said, “The meeting was fruitful. It brought back life to the industry and made me happy. I could say we welcome meeting the minister.” Ferguson said the industry was one which brought forex and economically empowered lower socio-economic groups in the country. He added that the minister wanted to know why such an industry was “suffering.” “One of the things he said was we have the stock to export. We are not importing any stock. We have the stock to sell out already. All the old iron is to go out. “He is saying why something like this is not going on. We were doing so good between 2021-22 and it declined.” Ferguson said Maharaj is willing to work with the industry to develop it. He could not say if there would be a removal of the licensing regime but said there'd definitely be some changes to the current legislation. Ferguson and his executive would send their recommendations to Maharaj after a zoom meeting. The association’s secretary Willetta Wilson and vice president Eross Seejattan were also present at the meeting. Ferguson said the draconian laws under which industry practitioners were operating would no longer be there and it was a happy day for scrap-iron dealers all across the country. Asked about errant people in the industry and laws to combat theft, Ferguson said working with the police, ministry of trade and others will provide answers as to how to combat this. “These areas must be attacked within the law and it must not be the association to stop the theft. That is not our work. “If a member steals, we suspend them. But when it comes to the laws of Trinidad and Tobago, that is why we are asking for the body to come in place to be able to deal with all these problems and recommend laws and good things for the industry to run.” The post Scrap iron dealers make case for regulatory body appeared first on Trinidad and Tobago Newsday .",

He added that the minister wanted to know why such an industry was “suffering.” “One of the things he said was we have the stock to export. We are not importing any stock. We have the stock to sell out already. All the old iron is to go out. “He is saying why something like this is not going on. We were doing so good between 2021-22 and it declined.” Ferguson said Maharaj is willing to work with the industry to develop it. He could not say if there would be a removal of the licensing regime but said there'd definitely be some changes to the current legislation. Ferguson and his executive would send their recommendations to Maharaj after a zoom meeting. The association’s secretary Willetta Wilson and vice president Eross Seejattan were also present at the meeting. Ferguson said the draconian laws under which industry practitioners were operating would no longer be there and it was a happy day for scrap-iron dealers all across the country. Asked about errant people in the industry and laws to combat theft, Ferguson said working with the police, ministry of trade and others will provide answers as to how to combat this. “These areas must be attacked within the law and it must not be the association to stop the theft. That is not our work. “If a member steals, we suspend them. But when it comes to the laws of Trinidad and Tobago, that is why we are asking for the body to come in place to be able to deal with all these problems and recommend laws and good things for the industry to run.” The post Scrap iron dealers make case for regulatory body appeared first on Trinidad and Tobago Newsday .",

      "description": "An Arouca police constable has appeared before a High Court master charged with the theft of a bulletproof vest, which allegedly went missing from the Guard and Emergency Branch (GEB) operation response unit in Aranguez, earlier in May. PC Justin Simmons, 34, of Sangre Grande, appeared before Master Rehanna Hosein, charged with simple larceny of government property. He was granted $150,000 bail. The matter was transferred to the Port of Spain magistrates’ court, and Simmons will appear there on June 25. He is represented by attorney Terry Boyer. Simmons is alleged to have stolen the Point Blank bulletproof vest, valued at $2,660, between April 28 and May 23. According to police reports, an officer assigned to GEB reported that he secured his police-issued vest inside his lock at the ORU base at Garden Road, Aranguez, on April 30, before going on vacation leave. After returning to duty on May 2, he checked his locker and discovered the vest missing. A week later, three officers at the GEB also reported their lockers had been broken into between the evening of May 8 and the morning of May 9. Among the items they reported missing were digital camouflage pants, utility belts, identification cards, rapid assault camouflage jackets, dump pouches, pistol holsters, $1,160 in cash, debit and credit cards, national identification cards, and other personal items. Earlier in May, two police officers were given the all-clear to pursue a lawsuit over being transferred from GEB after they were interrogated over police uniforms that went missing from an office in May 2024. According to court filings, several GEB uniforms went missing from the unit’s headquarters in Aranguez and the Prime Minister’s Guard Unit (at the Office of the Prime Minister) in May 2024, but no report was made against them, nor were they told they were suspects. However, their lawsuit said they formed the opinion that their transfers were linked to the alleged theft of the uniforms. On May 17, acting DCP Operations Curt Simon ordered an audit into all police uniforms, vehicles and computers belonging to the police service. His order came after the most recent reports of theft at the GEB base. The post Cop charged with theft of bulletproof vest granted $150k bail appeared first on Trinidad and Tobago Newsday .",

Around 1 am on May 27, the victim was heading west along the Beetham Highway in his white Nissan Tiida, when he lost control of the car and crashed near Vehicle Maintenance Corporation of TT’s (VMCOTT) compound. He managed to escape the wreck without any life-threatening injuries. While waiting for help to arrive, a group of men came from the direction of Beetham Gardens and announced a robbery. They stole his gold chain valued $15,000, an iPhone 8 worth $1,000 and $500 in cash. The men then ran back towards Beetham Gardens and escaped. An ambulance arrived some time later and took the man to the Port of Spain General Hospital where was warded for the injuries he sustained in the accident. Meanwhile police in Port of Spain are investigating the theft of cash and other valuables from joggers’ cars at the bottom of Lady Chancellor Hill. The victims told police they parked their cars on the southern side of Lady Chancellor Hill at around 6.20 pm on May 26, and they went to exercise. They returned around 8 pm and one of the victims saw the rear left window of his Honda Vezel was damaged and a laptop bag with $1,000 cash, his ID cards, bank cards, iPhone 13, and an electric shaver was missing.

      "description": "Overcome with grief and sorrow, 12 days after losing his 17-year-old son Zwade Alleyne, Nigel Alleyne struggled to come to terms with a world that no longer had his boy in it. \"Why allyuh do that boy? Why allyuh do that to my son, boy? Zwade, papa missing yuh,\" he cried out in anguish as he spoke at the funeral at Constantine Park in Macoya on May 27. It was a place young Alleyne knew well, having played football regularly there, before a bullet to the head ended his life. During the funeral, he scored his final \"goal\" with the aid of his football teammates, friends and relatives. [caption id=\"attachment_1157405\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1024\"] Nigel Alleyne had to be supported as he spoke at the funeral for his murdered son Zwade Alleyne on Tuesday at Constantine Park in Macoya.[/caption] \"When you reach up there Zwade, don't let nobody sit down next to you, I coming and meet you. I don't want nobody come and sit down next to you. I have to be next to you every time I see you.\" Alleyne said he and Zwade shared a close relationship. He recalled one of his final memories with his son was when he called him on May 9, moments before he wrote a CSEC examination. Zwade was a form five student and aspiring footballer at the Arima North Secondary School. \"If I was God, I would've just bring you back out of this coffin right now and hug you up.\" As Alleyne ended his speech, he almost collapsed as relatives supported him physically while a chair was brought for him to sit in as he was also given some water to drink. When he regained his strength, Alleyne walked over to Zwade’s coffin. He cried out once more: \"Why Zwade? Why allyuh do that?\" Seconds later, he fell onto the grass where he lay weeping for several minutes. In contrast, Zwade’s mother Keisha Bethelmy, masked her grief with quiet strength. She was a constant figure, moving about to ensure everything ran smoothly during the funeral. During her speech, she said, \"Revenge belongs to God. Leave it in God's hands and let Him do His own judgement.\" She too recalled her final memories of her youngest child, hours before he was fatally shot metres away from the front door of their home. \"He was sick whole week and the Saturday (May 10) I went Arima and bought a roti for him. He didn't eat whole week, was only liquids. \"When I reach home he take four bites and said the roti finish. He was still hungry and decided to make macaroni and cheese. When he put the water to boil, he put on some slow music.\" Bethelmy said she told him to dance with her.

If is not FIFA they playing, is they phone they on or dominoes or monopoly they playing. They were never street children to say they on the block. The block was my house.\" She said after they ate, they went outside to take some breeze when gunmen came. Police said that on May 10 around 10.52 pm, they responded to a report of a shooting at Building 12 in Maloney. Witnesses said around 10.45 pm, Zwade and several teenagers were on the third floor when a group of gunmen shot at them from the southern side of the car park. The youths tried to duck, but Zwade was shot when he tried to get up. He was warded at the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex for five days. The bullet entered near his left ear and exited through the back of his skull. He was declared brain-dead by doctors and died at 4.15 pm on May 15.

On April 15, Ezekiel Ramdialsingh, a former student and footballer was murdered. He was gunned down after returning from a general election campaign meeting. He too had been liming with friends at a shop when a gunman approached and shot at them. He was metres away from his home. Bethelmy shared a message to those involved in a life of crime, specifically those who took her son's life. \"To you young men who just come in the building and shooting up wild, wild...Lord have mercy on allyuh! I will plead for the young people to put down the guns. Please put down the guns.\" She said there were too many \"senseless\" murders in the country. \"We need to know what is love. Change guns into love. Love one another, we need it in this country. And parents, love your children. Stop encouraging them in wrong. Stop encouraging them to pick up a gun.\" She also urged all politicians – Government and Opposition – to work together to put a stop to gun violence. Apostle Justin Smith also delivered the sermon, called on youths attending the funeral to \"be saved,\" as he prayed that they would not become another statistic. Before the final viewing of Zwade’s body, his teammates, friends and family gathered to help him score his \"final goal.\" Forming two lines, they gently passed a football down the path which ended with Zwade in his casket which was positioned just in front of the goal. The ball was kicked and ricocheted off the casket into the goal. A cheer rang out.

      "description": "The International Book Fair Bookfest, now in its 18th edition, opened its doors on Wednesday, May 28, at Romexpo in Bucharest, with a varied program of book launches, debates, and other events. The fair will be open until Sunday, June 1. Visitors to Bookfest will have nearly 160 booths to see. Publishers have prepared special packages with the best offers and discounts, but also meetings with many cultural personalities from Romania and Portugal, which is the guest of honor of this edition. The guest country has prepared daily events, book launches, debates, and workshops for children. On Thursday, for example, on the Arena stage, the public is invited to attend an engaging debate titled “Reading as Public Space: How Books Keep a Democratic Society Alive,” supported by Henrique Mota (former president of the Portuguese Publishers Association and of the Federation of European Publishers), literary agent Simona Kessler, editor Lidia Bodea, and professor Mircea Vasilescu, moderated by former Minister of Culture Corina Şuteu. Portugal’s booth will also host a roundtable titled “Cultural Journalism: Art or a Form of Social Coagulation?” with guests Ana Margarida de Carvalho and Ioana Stăncescu, moderated by Iolanda Frandeş-Vasile, according to the organizers cited by News.ro . On Saturday, Portuguese writer David Machado will talk about the novel Average Happiness Index . The final days of Bookfest include events dedicated to major names of Portuguese literature, such as Antonio Lobo Antunes, who will be honored on Saturday, on the Agora stage, starting at 12:00 PM, with the Romanian translation of the novel Fado Alexandrino as a starting point. The event will be attended by professor Carmen Muşat, writer Radu Paraschivescu, translators Cristina Dăscălescu Dordea and Dinu Flămând, and the director of the Camões Institute, Ana Rita de Sousa. Among the most important contemporary authors who will be at Bookfest are Mircea Cărtărescu, Gabriel Liiceanu, Mircea Mihăieş, Doina Ruşti, Radu Paraschivescu, Tatiana Niculescu, Ioana Pârvulescu, Adrian Miroiu, Cristian Preda, Robert Şerban, Denisa Comănescu, Dinu Flămând, as well as Cristina Andone, Augustin Cupşa, or Alex Moldovan. Each will be present at the publishers’ booths or on the open stages for launches, interviews, and autograph sessions, the organizers announce.

      "description": "The 24th edition of the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF) in Cluj-Napoca is set to spotlight the most powerful Romanian films of the year, with the Romanian Days section showcasing a record number of documentaries and high-profile premieres. Eight feature films — six of them documentaries — and 20 short films will compete for the festival’s top national honors, including Best Feature Film, Best Debut, and Best Short Film. Among the standout titles in competition is Traffic , directed by Teodora Ana Mihai and written by Cristian Mungiu. Inspired by the notorious 2012 art heist at the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam, the film goes beyond crime drama to explore the harsh realities faced by migrant workers in Western Europe. Featuring Anamaria Vartolomei and cinematography by Marius Panduru, Traffic won the Grand Prize at the Warsaw Film Festival. Also drawing international acclaim is Father , a deeply emotional documentary by Lina Vdovîi and Radu Ciorniciuc, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film follows a Moldovan journalist as she reconnects with her estranged father in Italy and unearths buried trauma from his past as a migrant laborer. Two more documentaries rely entirely on archival material: Bright Future by Andra MacMasters examines Romania’s participation in the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students in North Korea, while Merman by Ana Lungu weaves three stories from WWII to the end of communism into a reflective essay film. Premiering at TIFF, Love Hurts by Alexandru Mavrodineanu offers a raw look at long-term romantic relationships through the lens of two real couples, while Beyond the River , directed by Endre David, documents the social and physical isolation of a Roma community in rural Transylvania. In A Rebel Edge , director Bogdan Pușlenghea traces the life of Doru Chirodea, an underground poet whose journey bridges 1980s America and post-communist Romania. Another highly anticipated entry is The New Year That Never Came , the feature debut of Gopo Award-winning filmmaker Bogdan Mureșanu. Set on the cusp of the Romanian Revolution in December 1989, the tragicomic ensemble film premiered at the Venice Film Festival, winning both the Orizzonti Award and the FIPRESCI Prize. Out of competition, TIFF will present major new Romanian works, including Kontinental ’25 by Radu Jude — awarded the Silver Bear for Best Screenplay at the Berlinale — and Sleep #2 , Jude’s experimental webcam-based homage to Andy Warhol. Tudor Giurgiu’s The Spruce Forest , premiering at TIFF, revisits the 1941 Fântâna Albă massacre, while Comatogen by Igor Cobileanski delivers a moral fable told from multiple perspectives. The festival also features Tooth and Nail , a satirical documentary by Mihai Dragolea and Radu Mocanu; Caliu. Nothing Else. What Else Could I Do? , a portrait of the legendary Clejani fiddler; Little Syria , a German-Romanian co-production about Syrian refugees in Berlin; and TWST – Things We Said Today , the latest from renowned director Andrei Ujică. The Romanian Days short film section reflects the vitality of the country’s cinematic landscape, with Cannes selections Alișveriș by Vasile Todinca and Milk and Cookies by Andrei Tache-Codreanu, as well as new works from acclaimed directors Florin Șerban, Claudiu Mitcu, Octav Chelaru, and Igor Cobileanski. Bogdan Mureșanu’s The Magician , recently featured at Annecy, also joins the lineup. Legendary filmmaker Béla Tarr, one of the most important and influential auteurs in contemporary cinema, will be the guest of honor at the 24th edition of TIFF, taking place June 13–22 in Cluj-Napoca. Tarr will be presented with the festival’s Lifetime Achievement Award and will hold a special masterclass for young filmmakers and festival audiences at Transilvania IFF 24. Tickets and passes for TIFF.24 are now available at tiff.eventbook.ro. irina.marica@romania-insider.com (Photo source: the organizers)",

      "title": "Report: Mortgage market in Romania to top EUR 5 bln in 2025, driven by Bucharest region",
      "description": "Bucharest and its surrounding Ilfov county are expected to account for more than one-third of all mortgage loans granted in Romania in 2025, as the nationwide mortgage market is set to surpass the EUR 5 billion threshold, according to a report from online broker Ipotecare.ro and mortgage lending company SVN Credit Romania. The report estimates that over 76,000 new mortgage loans could be approved this year, excluding refinancings, restructurings, conversions, and credit transfers. Based on these projections, mortgage-backed transactions could make up 45% of residential real estate deals in Romania, while cash transactions would represent 55%. Beyond Bucharest, only two other regions are forecast to draw in over 10% of national mortgage activity. The Banat region - comprising counties such as Timiș and Arad - is projected to account for approximately 12.7% of all new mortgages, thanks in large part to robust lending in Timișoara. The Crisana–Maramureș area, which includes Cluj, Bihor, and Baia Mare, follows with an estimated 10% market share. “2025 projects itself as the best year for the mortgage market in Romania, with a new record for loans granted for residential transactions – the decrease in fixed interest rates and the revenue increases are the main explanations,” said Alexandru Rădulescu, managing partner SVN Romania | Credit & Financial Solutions, the exclusive partner of Ipotecare.ro. “We also observe a reduction in the gap between the Bucharest region and the other regions in the country, which in turn are recording an accelerated development, led by Timisoara, Cluj – Oradea, Sibiu – Brasov and Iasi – Suceva – Bacau as the local locomotives for the profile market,” he added. Mortgage activity in central Transylvania and Moldova is also expected to reach around 10% each, while Oltenia, which includes counties like Dolj and Gorj, will see the lowest volume with about 5,000 mortgages granted. The average mortgage loan in Romania stands at approximately EUR 65,700. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the total value of mortgage loans reached EUR 2.75 billion - up 46% compared to the same period last year, according to data from the National Bank of Romania. However, home sales at the national level declined by nearly 5% year-over-year during the same timeframe, the National Agency for Cadastre and Land Registration reported. SVN Romania brokered EUR 160 million worth of mortgage loans in 2024. The company operates four offices in Bucharest and 14 additional branches across the country, including in cities such as Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Iași, and Timișoara.

      "title": "Romania needs to build. Collaboration – a strategic necessity for this sector",
      "description": "The construction sector in Romania is going through a period of contradictions: on one hand, there is an acute need for development – infrastructure, housing, hospitals, schools. On the other hand, major projects are often delayed, hindered by administrative bottlenecks, labor shortages, or – less discussed but equally essential – the lack of genuine collaboration between the stakeholders involved. In this context, RCBB Gruppe – a construction company active in both Romania and Germany – draws attention to a recurring issue on Romanian construction sites: fragmentation, which hinders productivity and causes delays. “One of the hidden causes of delays and failures in construction is the lack of communication between partners. Genuine collaboration, based on trust and shared goals, is still rare. But Romania needs to build. And not just any kind of construction – we need projects delivered on time, at high quality, and within budget”, stated Dipl. Eng. Radu Balan, co-founder and Managing Partner of RCBB Gruppe (left) . A fragmented sector, often with divergent goals In many projects, each party – client, general contractor, subcontractor, supplier – pursues their own interest, without clear alignment with the project’s ultimate goal. This lack of unity creates major risks: overlaps, execution errors, increased costs, and contractual disputes. This situation is not unique to Romania, but it is intensified by: an underdeveloped organizational culture; the lack of coherent collaboration standards; a cumbersome and ever-changing legal framework; tensions in the relationship between authorities and the private sector. How to build a culture of well-executed projects The construction experience shows that the difference between a successful and a failed project lies not just in the budget or technology, but mainly in how people and organizations work together. That’s why Romania first and foremost needs a culture of well-executed construction, built on three pillars: A clear common objective – every party involved must understand and commit to the project’s end goal. Structured teamwork – collaboration goes beyond formal meetings and involves clear processes, accountability, and transparency. Continuous and professional communication – good decisions are not made in isolation, but through constant and honest dialogue between stakeholders. “In our nearly 7 years of experience in Germany, we’ve seen a culture of collaboration that doesn’t come from regulation, but from a shared understanding of roles. In Romania, we have the know-how, we have the energy, but sometimes we lack that shared culture. This must be built, step by step”, explains Dipl. Eng. Codrin Botezat, co-founder and Managing Partner of RCBB Gruppe (right) . What does a concrete example of collaboration look like? On one of RCBB’s recent projects in Germany, the work was completed ahead of the contractual deadline thanks to exemplary cooperation: a few workers identified a discrepancy between the execution plans and the on-site reality. Instead of continuing the work at the risk of a mistake, they immediately reported the issue. The site manager checked the situation, confirmed the problem, and forwarded the information to the client. A technical solution was found quickly, without additional financial impact. This quick reaction and good collaboration saved time, avoided costly corrections, and strengthened the client’s trust in the team. All of this was made possible by people who decided that “cutting corners” was not acceptable. If you identify a problem, you bring it up without fear of repercussions. And this is only possible when a climate of trust and personal accountability is created. Romania has the potential to create its own model It is essential for Romania to develop its own functional framework, tailored to local realities. This requires a change in mindset: from reactive and individualistic approaches to a proactive and collaborative one. This transformation is not just the responsibility of big companies or authorities. It requires the involvement of all stakeholders – from the construction worker on-site to the decision-maker in public institutions. Change doesn’t come from a one-time reform, but from consistency, leadership, and mutual professional respect. The construction sector in Romania needs more than just investments and manpower. It needs a paradigm shift where collaboration becomes the rule, not the exception. Without this shift, no national plan, no EU funding, and no ambitious project can be implemented efficiently or sustainably. The building of a modern Romania starts with a solid foundation: genuine collaboration between those who build it. *This is Partner Content.",

How to build a culture of well-executed projects The construction experience shows that the difference between a successful and a failed project lies not just in the budget or technology, but mainly in how people and organizations work together. That’s why Romania first and foremost needs a culture of well-executed construction, built on three pillars: A clear common objective – every party involved must understand and commit to the project’s end goal. Structured teamwork – collaboration goes beyond formal meetings and involves clear processes, accountability, and transparency. Continuous and professional communication – good decisions are not made in isolation, but through constant and honest dialogue between stakeholders. “In our nearly 7 years of experience in Germany, we’ve seen a culture of collaboration that doesn’t come from regulation, but from a shared understanding of roles. In Romania, we have the know-how, we have the energy, but sometimes we lack that shared culture. This must be built, step by step”, explains Dipl. Eng. Codrin Botezat, co-founder and Managing Partner of RCBB Gruppe (right) . What does a concrete example of collaboration look like? On one of RCBB’s recent projects in Germany, the work was completed ahead of the contractual deadline thanks to exemplary cooperation: a few workers identified a discrepancy between the execution plans and the on-site reality. Instead of continuing the work at the risk of a mistake, they immediately reported the issue. The site manager checked the situation, confirmed the problem, and forwarded the information to the client. A technical solution was found quickly, without additional financial impact. This quick reaction and good collaboration saved time, avoided costly corrections, and strengthened the client’s trust in the team. All of this was made possible by people who decided that “cutting corners” was not acceptable. If you identify a problem, you bring it up without fear of repercussions. And this is only possible when a climate of trust and personal accountability is created. Romania has the potential to create its own model It is essential for Romania to develop its own functional framework, tailored to local realities. This requires a change in mindset: from reactive and individualistic approaches to a proactive and collaborative one. This transformation is not just the responsibility of big companies or authorities. It requires the involvement of all stakeholders – from the construction worker on-site to the decision-maker in public institutions. Change doesn’t come from a one-time reform, but from consistency, leadership, and mutual professional respect. The construction sector in Romania needs more than just investments and manpower. It needs a paradigm shift where collaboration becomes the rule, not the exception. Without this shift, no national plan, no EU funding, and no ambitious project can be implemented efficiently or sustainably. The building of a modern Romania starts with a solid foundation: genuine collaboration between those who build it. *This is Partner Content.",

      "title": "Prosecutors extend probe on fascist rhetoric of Romanian isolationist politician Călin Georgescu",
      "description": "The General Prosecutor's Office announced on May 27 the extension of the criminal prosecution against Călin Georgescu for the crime of publicly promoting the cult of persons guilty of committing crimes of genocide against humanity and war crimes, as well as the act of publicly promoting fascist, legionary, racist or xenophobic ideas, concepts or doctrines, according to G4media.ro . Georgescu announced on May 26 that he is stepping away from active political life to focus on his family, which he says needs \"peace and especially health\" after a tumultuous period. He entered Romanian politics with no announcement through an intense TikTok campaign ahead of the November/December 2024 presidential elections, supposedly backed by irregular activity on social media networks that prompted the annulment of the presidential ballot. \"During a television show on May 16, 2025, between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM, at a prime time, the person mentioned above promoted fascist and legionary ideas, concepts or doctrines propagated by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Legionary Movement, and by Marshal Ion Antonescu, convicted of war crimes by decision no. 17 of May 17, 1946 pronounced by the People's Tribunal, by imitating their behavior and dialogue,\" according to the General Prosecutor's Office. Georgescu is already under investigation for stronger accusations, however – and the outcome was not yet announced publicly. Romanian prosecutors have announced six charges against Călin Georgescu, who was picked up by police while in traffic on the morning of February 26 and taken for questioning to the Prosecutor General's Office (PICCJ).  All six charges relate to the financing of his presidential campaign and his collaboration with, or support from, extremist illegal organisations that have been tolerated and have flourished in the 35 years since the fall of communism. Lines of investigation include suspected connections between Georgescu's bodyguard, Horatiu Potra, and Russia's paramilitary Wagner Group. Besides his conspiracist rhetoric, Georgescu has repeatedly praised the Iron Guard - a religious fascist movement and political party founded in 1927 by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as the Legion of the Archangel Michael - and Ion Antonescu, who was responsible for facilitating the Holocaust in Romania. Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round of the annulled presidential elections in November 2024, following intense online activity allegedly instigated by Russian entities. There are also questions about his campaign financing, given that he claimed he spent nothing on his campaign. iulian@romania-insider.com (Photo source: Inquam Photos/George Calin)",

The discussion lasted about 10 minutes, and the American president reportedly invited Nicușor Dan to visit Washington. The main topics of discussion between the two leaders were regional security, energy, and the situation in Ukraine, according to G4media.ro . During the conversation, president Donald Trump reportedly invited Nicușor Dan to the United States, and Dan, in turn, invited the American leader to Romania. When asked about the telephone conversation with Donald Trump, president Nicuşor Dan said on Wednesday morning, May 28, that he neither confirms nor denies such a call, specifying that there are conversations that were agreed in advance to be communicated and others that are not. Dan replied that if he were invited to the White House by Donald Trump, he would go \"with great pleasure,\" News.ro reported. The development heralds the normalization of the bilateral ties, clouded by the annulment of the presidential ballot last year – an incident capitalized by the isolationist politicians George Simion and Calin Georgescu. On May 20, after Nicușor Dan won the presidential runoff, the United States Embassy in Bucharest sent the first message to the president-elect, stating that it looks forward to collaborating with the head of state and the new government to promote common interests. \"We look forward to working with Nicușor Dan, as president of Romania, and with the new Romanian government, to advance our shared priorities, such as defense, energy, and trade partnerships,\" the US Embassy said in the message posted on social media. On May 21, Nicuşor Dan sent thanks in a message posted on the X platform to US president Donald Trump after he announced the name of the new US ambassador to Bucharest.

      "description": "Romania's companies OMV Petrom (BVB: SNP) and Romgaz (BVB: SNG) are in second and third place, respectively, in the top European companies with the highest obligations in the construction of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage facilities, the European Commission established on May 21, within the framework of the \"Net 0 2030\" decarbonization plan, according to Economedia.ro . It's a target set based on past national hydrocarbon production and will be backed with financial support. \"By combining their industrial know-how with faster-permitting processes and strong financial support – including from the ETS-funded Innovation Fund – we can make substantial progress in advancing decarbonization and industrial modernization in Europe,\" explained Kurt Vandenberghe, European Commission Director-General for Climate Action. For the two Romanian companies, a quota of 9 million tons of CO2 was established last year as a storage obligation until 2030. It is the second largest national quota in the EU, after that of the Netherlands, with the entire Union committing to storing at least 50 million tons underground. The reason Romanian hydrocarbon-producing companies (not the country itself) have such a high share is related to the past activity: Romania has a 150-year tradition of hydrocarbon extraction. A number of 44 European companies are required to ensure operational CO2 injection capacity by December 31, 2030, in geological storage sites authorized under the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Directive. iulian@romania-insider.com (Photo source: Audioundwerbung / Dreamstime.com )",

      "description": "Expectations for Romania’s economic performance have deteriorated significantly among companies in the German-Romanian business community, according to the 2025 business survey released this spring by AHK Romania, the Romanian-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The share of companies with a pessimistic view of the Romanian economy rose from 38% in 2024 to 57% in 2025, reflecting heightened uncertainty and concerns about market conditions. While the outlook for individual business performance remains unchanged for 38% of respondents, only 37% anticipate economic improvement this year, compared to 40% in 2024. Most companies (62%) described their current business situation as “satisfactory,” a marginal increase from 59% last year. However, optimism continues to decline, with only 28% rating their current position as good, down from 33% in 2024 and continuing a three-year downward trend. The survey also points to a notable drop in investment intentions. In 2024, 46% of companies planned to maintain their investment levels, but this figure has fallen to 38% in 2025. Furthermore, 30% of companies reported plans to reduce investments this year, up from 20% in 2024. Labor market sentiment has also shifted, with 34% of companies indicating they would reduce staff in 2025, compared to just 18% the previous year. Meanwhile, 41% plan to maintain their current headcount, the same proportion as in 2024. Companies cited declining demand and increasing cost pressures as primary reasons for the planned workforce reductions and the push to increase productivity. “Companies are more cautious, which is reflected in the investment and employment decisions,” AHK Romania stated in the report. The survey results reflect broader concerns across sectors, particularly in manufacturing and services, regarding inflation, regulatory instability, and geopolitical risks. iulian@romania-insider.com (Photo source: Yunkiphotoshot/Dreamstime.com )",

      "description": "Daniel Dăianu, president of Romania’s Fiscal Council, warned that reducing the country’s high budget deficit cannot be achieved solely through expenditure cuts, insisting that increased tax revenues and higher tax rates are unavoidable. Speaking in Parliament on May 27, he described the deficit as \"gangrene\" for the Romanian economy and said relying on spending cuts alone is an illusion. “Those who support the thesis that the deficit correction can only be done on the expenditure side are chasing a chimera. Such a thing is not possible,” Dăianu stated, as quoted by News.ro , referencing analyses conducted by the Fiscal Council and his own judgment. “I believe that we cannot avoid increasing the state's fiscal revenues through some increases in taxes and duties. These are personal opinions,” he added. Romania recorded a 2.95% deficit-to-GDP ratio in the first four months of 2025, with full-year projections expected to reach 7% or higher. Dăianu argued that the structural imbalance in Romania’s public finances cannot be resolved without tax reform. “A substantial increase in tax revenues, from much better collection, is not possible,” he said, adding that only new tax measures can close the fiscal gap. He also rejected the idea, floated by some political leaders, that savings of RON 30 billion could be made through spending cuts alone. “I don’t believe that,” he said. “If you look at the structure of the public budget, you will notice that by far, the bulk is held by salaries and pensions. First of all, you can’t cut salaries and pensions as you want.” While Dăianu acknowledged that there may be some room to reduce expenditures on goods and services, he stressed that such cuts would be insufficient. “Romanian society has been living on the budget far beyond its means,” he said, cautioning that the fiscal burden does not fall solely on civil servants but also on essential public sector workers like teachers and doctors. iulian@romania-insider.com (Photo source: Inquam Photos/George Calin)",

      "title": "Romania's public deficit moderates at 2.95% of GDP in January-April",
      "description": "The general government budget deficit in Romania contracted by 2.3% y/y to RON 56.0 billion (EUR 11.1 billion, cash terms) in January-April, according to data published by the Finance Ministry. The deficit-to-GDP figure increased to 2.95% for the first four months of the year from 3.25% in the same period of 2024 but advanced from 2.28% in the first quarter of 2025. Romania set a 7%-of-GDP deficit target for 2025 (both cash and ESA terms) but admits that a more feasible figure would be 7.5% – which would also be seen by the rating agencies as a reasonable performance, enough to keep the country's debt in the investment-grade region. The country's deficit hit 8.6% of GDP in cash terms and 9.3% of GDP in ESA terms last year. Finance minister Tanczos Barna highlighted the 16% y/y advance in revenues in April alone, driven by better VAT collection, and the 3.9% y/y decline of public expenditures with goods and services in the month. \"The budget execution in the first four months of the year shows that securing sources of income to maintain the investment pace and pay the salaries and pensions, which increased last year, is a huge challenge. Romania will be able to achieve the deficit targets assumed only through firm measures, reducing spending and creating a more flexible state,\" Tánczos Barna wrote in a Facebook post. The new government will have to take steps towards consolidating revenues and, more significantly, reduce expenditures, minister Barna said. The budget execution annual dynamic was partly impacted by high-base effects – but it was more than that. Profit.ro argued in mid-May, when the January-April budget execution data first surfaced, that the annual comparison is not fully relevant since the May pensions were paid in advance (in April) last year, causing high base effects. Adjusted for that anomaly, the real deficit for January-April 2024 was 2.7% of GDP, Profit.ro said – indicating a y/y advance in 2025. However, more granular data show broader improvement in the budget execution this year. Specifically, the improvement in budget execution during April was seen in both revenues and expenditures. The revenues increased by 9.4% y/y to RON 199.9 million in the first four months of 2025, compared to a 6.9% y/y advance in Q1, while the tax revenues increased by 12.8% y/y (+10.0% y/y in Q1). Compared to the full-year GDP (projected for 2025), the budget revenues advanced to 10.6% in January-April this year, up from 10.4% in the same period of 2024. The increase in revenues was mainly supported by advances in revenues from salary and income tax, social security contributions, and excise duties. Income tax revenues recorded a remarkable evolution, reaching RON 19.62 billion, against the backdrop of an annual increase of 25.8% y/y. This was determined in particular by a doubling of dividend tax revenues following the distribution of profits related to 2024, still subject to an 8% tax rate (10% from 2025). Social insurance contributions increased by 10.2%, to RON 67.69 billion, a slower pace than the dynamics of the total wage fund in the economy, given that the transfer to the second pension pillar was higher than last year. Also, net revenues from the value-added tax were RON 39.04 billion, only 1.2% above the level of the same period last year, a moderate evolution influenced by higher VAT refunds and a consistent base effect. The budget expenditures increased by only 6.6% y/y to RON 255.9 billion in January-April, compared to a 10.1% y/y advance in Q1. The expenditures-to-GDP ratio edged down marginally to 13.5% from 13.6% in the same period of 2024. The interest on public debt still increased by 48% y/y to RON 20.4 billion and weighted 8.0% of total expenditures, up from 5.7% in the same period last year. Personnel expenses reached RON 56.6 billion, 12.4% up y/y, representing 3.0% of GDP (2.9% in 2024). Expenditure on goods and services remained almost constant, with an increase of only 0.8% y/y, including a 5.4% advance in the public health system (CNAS) budget, for the settlement of compensated and free medicines, as well as for the financing of national health programs. Social assistance expenditures amounted to RON 85.6 billion, up 2.3% y/y, influenced by the recalculation of public pensions under Law 360/2023, applicable from September 1, 2024, but also by energy bill compensation schemes, which amounted to RON 1.55 billion. Public investment, including both capital expenditures and programs financed from domestic and foreign sources, stood at RON 32.41 billion, 3.6% up y/y. However, expenditures for projects financed from non-reimbursable external funds were down by 5.7% y/y, signaling a possible delay in the absorption of available European funds. Overall, the budget execution in the first four months of 2025 confirms a moderate fiscal consolidation achieved through increasing current revenues and prudent expenditure management, especially in the investment area. However, the pressures exerted by the increasing interest rates and the ongoing social measures continue to limit the fiscal space available in the period ahead. iulian@romania-insider.com (Photo source: Alexandru Marinescu/Dreamstime.com )",

The budget expenditures increased by only 6.6% y/y to RON 255.9 billion in January-April, compared to a 10.1% y/y advance in Q1. The expenditures-to-GDP ratio edged down marginally to 13.5% from 13.6% in the same period of 2024. The interest on public debt still increased by 48% y/y to RON 20.4 billion and weighted 8.0% of total expenditures, up from 5.7% in the same period last year. Personnel expenses reached RON 56.6 billion, 12.4% up y/y, representing 3.0% of GDP (2.9% in 2024). Expenditure on goods and services remained almost constant, with an increase of only 0.8% y/y, including a 5.4% advance in the public health system (CNAS) budget, for the settlement of compensated and free medicines, as well as for the financing of national health programs. Social assistance expenditures amounted to RON 85.6 billion, up 2.3% y/y, influenced by the recalculation of public pensions under Law 360/2023, applicable from September 1, 2024, but also by energy bill compensation schemes, which amounted to RON 1.55 billion. Public investment, including both capital expenditures and programs financed from domestic and foreign sources, stood at RON 32.41 billion, 3.6% up y/y. However, expenditures for projects financed from non-reimbursable external funds were down by 5.7% y/y, signaling a possible delay in the absorption of available European funds. Overall, the budget execution in the first four months of 2025 confirms a moderate fiscal consolidation achieved through increasing current revenues and prudent expenditure management, especially in the investment area. However, the pressures exerted by the increasing interest rates and the ongoing social measures continue to limit the fiscal space available in the period ahead. iulian@romania-insider.com (Photo source: Alexandru Marinescu/Dreamstime.com )",

      "description": "Guineenses, mais uma vez, venho para vos alertar sobre o perigo que Domingos Simões Pereira representa para a Guiné-Bissau. Faço esse alerta a todos os guineenses sem exceção que se encontre no país ou no estrangeiro, ao PAIGC em especial e na pessoa do Cipriano Cassamá em concreto. Alerta esse sobre o verdadeiro DSP, o verdadeiro espírito que move esse sujeito, o qual alguns ainda continuam a acreditar para não dizer adorar. Domingos Simões Pereira é um manipulador, um verdadeiro chantagista e calculista provavelmente, tipo de comportamento que ultrapassa o nível de psicopata. U m ambicioso desmedido, um verdadeiro criminoso que sabe como e quando cometer o crime. Ele jamais coabitaria não só com JOMAV, assim como com qualquer presidente que seria eleito, a não ser o que ele apoiou disfarçadamente. Isto porque ele tem sua própria agenda, e o PAIGC é simplesmente uma plataforma para sua concretização. DSP jamais coabitaria com JOMAV porque o seu candidato preferido era o Paulo Gomes e sempre será, o qual juntamente com Tchitchi vão delineando mecanismo de modo a serem os novos donos da Guiné-Bissau. Segundo eles este é um processo a médio prazo, e é preciso coragem e paciência para concretiza-lo. Ganhar o congresso não importa em que circunstância e ter novamente o partido na mão, é uma fase concluída em proveito deles, enquanto verdadeiros militantes do PAIGC estão a bater palmas. Depois dessa eleição legislativa, não importa o resultado, o Cipriano Cassama que se prepare a mala ou fica de bico fechado, pois o candidato preferido para o partido será o Paulo Gomes, e esse sim deve ter a voz dentro do partido. DSP é um ambicioso desmedido, nunca teve consideração por ninguém, JOMAV muito menos, o sujeito é um maquiavélico nato, Cipriano Casama será descartado quando menos esperar podes tomar a nota. Guineenses, falar do Paulo Gomes e Tchitchi é falar do MCCI e demais outras organizações e personalidades camufladas no nosso país. Esses dois indivíduos são os principais financiadores do MCCI e demais outras personalidades boca de aluguel na cidade de Bissau. O MCCI, Milícia idealizado por JBV e DSP, agora financiado e dirigido por \"futuro triângulo do poder\" ou seja, \"DSP, Paulo Gomes e Tchitchi\", têm 3 principais objectivos: 1º Perturbar a ordem pública em nome da cidadania, difamar e tentar descredibilizar qualquer que seja organizações ou indivíduos não alinhados ao triângulo, de modo a suportar suas caminhadas na busca do poder. 2º Caso se concretize o objectivo do triângulo, o papel da Milícia do MCCI passará a ser de vigilância constante a todos os adversários de modo a garantir falsa paz social e o poder de controlo. 3º Tentar ganhar credibilidade junto das organizações internacionais e regionais, através de suas visitas e actividades de fachada, para quando houver as tais actividades de perturbações de ordem pública, poderem ganhar notoriedade. Mas isso não deve preocupar ninguém, pois estão bem identificados e bem caçados, dentro e fora da Guiné-Bissau. Não tenho nada contra ninguém, mas quem continuar a perturbar verdadeira paz social dos guineenses em troca de benefícios como sempre foi nos últimos anos dessa crise, e que sempre tenho tolerado, então que fique claro \"estou firme e determinado para tudo e todos\". Para finalizar, gostaria de vos deixar uma reflexão com a seguinte frase: \" Domingos Simões Pereira é um perigo grave para o futuro do país \". Isto porque publicar aqui tudo que é necessário para provar ou sustentar a razão dessa frase, só pode agravar ainda mais a paz social que tanto necessitamos. Chega, chega não podemos continuar a viver nessa turbulência vida toda, meus irmãos guineenses, não é saudável, é tóxico, não é justo para um povo que tanto sofreu.

      "translatedDescription": "Guineans, once again, come to alert you to the danger that Domingos Simões Pereira represents to Guinea-Bissau. I make this alert to all Guineans without exception that you are in the country or abroad, to the PAIGC in particular and the person of Cyprian Cassamá in concrete. Warns this about the true DSP, the true spirit that moves this subject, which some still continue to believe not to say to worship. Domingos Simões Pereira is a manipulator, a real blackmailer and calculator, probably, kind of behavior that goes beyond the psychopath level. An ambitious excessive, a true criminal who knows how and when to commit the crime. He would never cohabble not only with Jomav, as well as with any president who would be elected, except what he supported undercover. This is because it has its own agenda, and PAIGC is simply a platform for its realization. DSP would never cohabble with Jomav because his favorite candidate was Paulo Gomes and always will be, who together with Tchitchi are outlining mechanism so that they are the new owners of Guinea-Bissau. According to them this is a process in the medium term, and it takes courage and patience to realize it. Winning Congress does not matter under what circumstances and have the party again in hand, it is a phase completed for them, while true PAIGC militants are clapping. After this legislative election, no matter the result, Cipriano Cassama who prepares the suitcase or is closed, because the favorite candidate for the party will be Paulo Gomes, and this must have his voice inside the party. DSP is an ambitious excessive, never considered by anyone, much less Jomav, the subject is a born Machiavellian, Cyprian Casama will be discarded when least expecting you can take the note. Guineans, talking about Paulo Gomes and Tchitchi is talking about MCCI and other other camouflaged organizations and personalities in our country. These two individuals are MCCI's main funders and other other rental mouths in the city of Bissau. The MCCI, a militia designed by JBV and DSP, now funded and directed by \"future triangle of power\" ie \"DSP, Paulo Gomes and Tchitchi\", have 3 main objectives: 1st disrupting public order in the name of citizenship, defaming and trying to disbelief whatever organizations or individuals not aligned with the triangle in order to support their walks in the search for power. 2º If the objective of the triangle is realized, the role of the MCCI militia will become constant surveillance to all opponents to ensure false social peace and the power of control. 3º Try to gain credibility with international and regional organizations, through their visits and facade activities, so when there are such public order disturbance activities, they can gain notoriety. But this should not worry anyone, as they are well identified and well hunted, inside and outside Guinea-Bissau. I have nothing against anyone, but those who continue to disturb true social peace of the Guineans in exchange for benefits as always has been in the last years of this crisis, and that I have always tolerated, so that it is clear \"I am firm and determined for everything and everyone.\" Finally, I would like to leave you a reflection with the following sentence: \"Domingos Simões Pereira is a serious danger to the country's future.\" This is because publishing here everything that is necessary to prove or support the reason for this sentence, can only further aggravate the social peace we need so much. Enough, enough we can not continue to live in this turbulence all life, my Guinean brothers, is not healthy, it is toxic, not fair to a people who suffered so much.

      "description": "DSP através da sua equipa de \"Lambe-Botas\" está cavando cada vez mais a sua própria cova, adiantando cada vez mais o seu fim. Somente alguns acreditavam que foi ele quem estava por trás do \"Progresso Nacional\" o blog onde começou toda essa história de Mentiras, Calunias, Difamações, Ameaças e tantos outros agressões tóxicas ao espírito humano, a todos os que não estão do seu lado e cujo o único objectivo, era ser chamado de rei dos réis da Guiné. Comandou o Progresso Nacional assim como Bin Laden comandou a Al-Qaeda e acabou por fracassar. Pensou, repensou e resolveu voltar novamente ainda com mais TERROR e está a comandar o Guiné Puro tentando levar toda a nação ao abismo assim como o ISIS quer levar a humanidade. Camaradas, Guiné Puro assim como o falecido Progresso Nacional é o reflexo do espirito de DSP, alí é possivel ver tudo e quanto o sujeito é baixo. DSP é um hipócrita e um anarquista moderno. \"ACHAS QUE AS NOSSAS MARCHAS SÃO RESULTADO DE VENDAS E COMPRAS?!\" essa foi uma das frases da recente publicação que mostram por quem e para que fim, é dirigido o Guiné Puro ou melhor o blog do terror como podem ver já a seguir. Demonstraram mais uma vez claramente que o \"MCCI\" pertence a DPS, pois uma publicação dessa no próprio blog do ganancioso só pode ser das duas uma: \"Boca capli elis ou Foronta passanta e dicidi ca sucundi rostu\". Camaradas, Domingos Simões Pereira afundou seu próprio barco devido a sua ganância e complexo de superioridade. \"I pirigu pa i faladu ba cuma, el i unicu alguim cu bai escola na Guiné\" seu ultimo desejo é \"afundar com todos, inclusive o PAIGC\". __________PARA A VOSSA CONFIRMAÇÃO, AQUI ESTÁ A PUBLICAÇÃO_________ MARCOS GALINA BARBOSA VAI PERCEBER QUE METEU COM GENTE\nPERSISTENTE.

      "translatedDescription": "DSP through your \"Lambe-Bota\" team is increasingly digging your own grave, increasingly advanced your end. Only a few believed that it was he who was behind \"national progress\" the blog where this whole story of lies, slander, defamation, threats, and so many other toxic aggressions to the human spirit began, to all who are not on his side and whose only goal, was to be called the king of the réis of Guinea. He commanded national progress just as Bin Laden commanded Al-Qaeda and ended up failing. He thought, rethought and decided to return even more terror and he is commanding the pure Guinea trying to bring the whole nation to the abyss just as Isis wants to bring humanity. Comrade, pure Guinea as well as the late national progress is the reflection of the DSP spirit, there it is possible to see everything and how low the subject is. DSP is a hypocritical and a modern anarchist. \"Do you think our gears are the result of sales and shopping?!\" This was one of the sentences of the recent publication that show by whom and to what end, the pure Guinea or rather the terror blog as you can see below. They have clearly demonstrated that \"MCCI\" belongs to DPS, because such a publication on the greedy blog itself can only be one of the two: \"Boca Capli Elis or Passant and Dicidi CA succundi rostu\". Comrades, Domingos Simões Pereira sank his own boat due to his greed and superiority complex. \"I Pirigu Pa I FALADU BA CUMA, El I Unicu some Cu Bai School in Guinea\" Your Last Desire is \"Sink with everyone, including PAIGC\". __________For your confirmation, here is the publication _________ Marcos Galina Barbosa will realize that it has gotten with people\nPERSISTENT.

      "description": "Os meios de comunicação também são as formas de manipulação mais utilizadas pelos poderes políticos, dado o seu impacto social. As informações são manipuladas não apenas tendo em vista omitir factos relevantes, mas também distorcer o conteúdo da informação veiculada, produzir ou forjar a opinião pública, de modo que a mesma se ajuste às ideias dos gananciosos. A única forma dos cidadãos evitarem cair nestes processos de manipulação é tornarem-se mais vigilantes em relação às instituições democráticas e aos órgãos de informação, adoptando uma atitude de permanente reflexão crítica sobre a informação que lhes é fornecida. Na Guiné-Bissau, nos últimos anos, cresceu exponencialmente o número de pessoas mediocres, pessoas sem escrúpulos ligadas à produção de rádios e outros meios de comunicação com influencia na nossa sociedade, gente que apesar da sua enorme influência na sociedade, trabalha na mais completa impunidade e sem qualquer controlo ético/democrático. Obcecado pelo poder, ciente da dificuldade do povo guineense em avaliar informações, ciente do poder dos instrumentos de comunicação, Domingos Simões Pereira (DSP) nunca menosprezou esses instrumentos para atingir seu objectivo, sempre usou-os de forma desonesta como agora está a fazer tudo por tudo para manter no controlo desses veicúlos, mesmo que isso custe a vida dos outros. Governou na corrupção, no nepotismo e no desvios de somas astronómicas do dinheiro de povo, que muito serviria para investimentos na saúde, educação e outros serviços publicos, para beneficiar familiares e amigos. Finge que preocupa com os problemas do país, mas só engana o povo honesto, humilde e trabalhador que infelizmente sofre muito, não sei até quando, devido a sua paciência e tolerância aos governantes como DSP, criminoso travestido em politico que vive na custa de povo e acima de tudo ainda fa-lo refem do próprio suor. Roubou e decepcionou tanto não só aos guineenses assim como a comunidade internacional que sempre acreditou que o sujeito era ideal para ajudar esse povo a sair do ciclo de sofrimento que parece infinito. Foi demitido, não conformou e está a fazer tudo na medida do possível para continuar a complicar a vida dos guineenses. Razão disso é que depois de perder a batalha nos meios de comunicações mais modernos nomeadamente os blogues onde investiu grandes somas do dinheiro de povo, para fazer a lavagem cerebral dos menos instruídos e não só. Fugiu do facebook onde sempre frequentava e comunicava com todos tentado passar a mensagem de um politico moderno e aberto a diálogo/opiniões, mas que afinal era simplesmente um falso modernista. Caiu a mascara e já não consegue enganar ninguem, pois a sua credibilidade está abaixo de zero, para não dizer outra coisa. Camaradas, para conhecimento geral, com o dinheiro roubado que custou suor de povo guineense, DSP decidiu avançar com um outro novo plano maquiavelico, para criar a sua própria estação de rádio.

      "translatedDescription": "The media are also the most used forms of manipulation by political powers, given their social impact. The information is manipulated not only in view of omitting relevant facts, but also distorting the content of the information conveyed, producing or forging public opinion, so that it adjusts to the ideas of the greedy. The only way for citizens to avoid falling into these manipulation processes is to become more vigilant in relation to democratic institutions and information bodies, adopting an attitude of permanent critical reflection on the information provided to them. In Guinea-Bissau, in recent years, the number of mediocre people has grown exponentially, unscrupulous people linked to the production of radios and other media with influence on our society, people who despite their enormous influence on society, work on more complete impunity and without any ethical/democratic control. Obsessed with power, aware of the difficulty of the Guinean people in evaluating information, aware of the power of communication instruments, Domingos Simões Pereira (DSP) has never belittled these instruments to achieve their goal, always used them dishonestly how it is now doing everything to keep in control of these vehicles, even if it costs the lives of others. He ruled in corruption, nepotism and deviations from astronomical sums of people's money, which would serve much for investments in health, education and other public services, to benefit family and friends. It pretends to worry about the problems of the country, but only deceives the honest, humble and worker people who are unfortunately suffering a lot, I don't know how long, due to their patience and tolerance to rulers like DSP, a politician-crossed criminal who lives at the expense of people and above all they still do so. He stole and disappointed so much not only to the Guineans as well as the international community that always believed that the subject was ideal to help these people get out of the suffering cycle that seems infinite. He was fired, did not conform and is doing everything as far as possible to continue to complicate the life of the Guineans. Reason for this is that after losing the battle in the most modern media, namely the blogs where it invested great sums of people's money, to make the brainwash of the less educated and beyond. He ran away from Facebook where he always attended and communicated with everyone attempted to give the message of a modern politician and open to dialogue/opinions, but after all he was simply a false modernist. The mask fell and can no longer fool anyone, because its credibility is below zero, not to say something else. Comrades, for general knowledge, with the stolen money that cost Guinean people sweat, DSP decided to advance with another new Machiavellian plan, to create his own radio station.
