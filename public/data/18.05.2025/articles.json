      "description": "Zelenskyy attacks Kremlin over killing of civilians in minibus as European leaders remain focused on keeping troops out of Ukraine. What we know on day 1,180 US president Donald Trump will speak to Vladimir Putin on Monday to stop the “bloodbath” war in Ukraine, saying the conflict is killing thousands of soldiers a week, “AND TRADE.” Trump wrote on social media he would follow-up that chat with another with Volodymyr Zelenskyy so the war “WILL END,” Oliver Millman reports. The leaders of Germany and Italy said Europe is a long way away from deploying any troops in Ukraine as all efforts remained focused on an unconditional ceasefire deal from Russia. Friedrich Merz, Germany’s chancellor, said there was “no reason” to talk about troops, adding “we are far from that.” Zelenskyy called for tougher sanctions on Moscow after a Russian strike on a minibus killed 9 people. Ukraine said the vehicle was evacuating civilians from a town in the Sumy region that has recently come under repeated Russian attacks. “All the deceased were civilians,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “And the Russians could not have failed to understand what kind of vehicle they were targeting. This was a deliberate killing of civilians.” The Ukrainian president has been meeting with a slate of leaders in Rome as he appeals for support in the ongoing talks . On X, Zelenskyy said he’s focused on a ceasefire, humanitarian commitments from allies and efforts to rebuild Ukraine once the conflict ends. US secretary of state Marco Rubio suggested the Vatican could serve as a future venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks , building on Pope Leo XIV’s vow to make “every effort” to help end the war. “I think it’s a place that both sides would be comfortable going,” Rubio told reporters. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, spoke with Rubio and said he welcomed the “positive role” of the US in helping to continue talks between the Kremlin and Ukraine. But Russia’s lead negotiator invoked the Kremlin’s past wars as it threatened the potential for a long conflict in Ukraine , Pjotr Sauer reports . “We don’t want war, but we are ready to fight for a year, two, three – as long as it takes,” Vladimir Medinsky reportedly told his Ukrainian counterparts. “We fought with Sweden for 21 years. How long are you ready to fight?” Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, reaffirmed the country’s support for Ukraine in his first face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy. “Canadian people will stand in steadfast and unwavering support,” Carney told the Ukrainian president. “We underscore that there can be no peace without the full support and participation of Ukraine, and that you have our absolute support.” The two met in Rome during the inaugural mass of the newly elected Pope.

While incarcerated PTI leaders including ex-ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, ex-governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Senator Ejaz Chaudhry were produced before Judge Manzer Ali Gill, who conducted the hearing inside the Kot Lakhpat jail, the latter was informed that ex-minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was shifted to Punjab Institute of Cardiology for a cardiac complaint before the hearing commenced. Also, PTI’s former lawmakers Aliya Hamza Malik and Rubina Jamil, social media activists Sanam Javed and Tayyaba Raja , fashion designer Khadija Shah and other suspects out on bail attended the hearing inside the jail. Senior lawyers Burhan Moazam Malik and Rana Mudassir Umar appeared on behalf of the suspects. After being provided with the copies of the charge-sheet, the suspects were informed that they would be indicted on May 24 in the case. Judge Gill of the ATC-1 later adjourned the proceedings. Sarwar Road police had registered an FIR against the PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking and vandalising the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander, during the May 9 protests against the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan in a graft case by National Accountability Bureau. Terrorism charge under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, and various other offences, including waging or attempting to wage war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan, abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty and rioting were added to the FIR. Meanwhile, another ATC court extended the pre-arrest bail of former legislator Aliya Hamza Malik till May 26 and two sisters of Mr Khan in multiple cases of attacks on police till May 30. Ms Malik appeared before the court on the expiry of her bail period while Aleema Khan and Uzma Khan sought one-time exemption from personal appearance.

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has obj­e­cted to the composition of an 11-judge constitutional bench hearing the reserved seats matter , with a request to refer the review petitions against the last year ruling to the relevant committee constituted under Supreme Court (Pra­c­tice and Procedure) Act, 2023, for the formation of a new bench. The objection was raised through an application filed by senior counsel Faisal Sid­diqi on behalf of the SIC after the party had requested the constitutional bench to decide the 26th Amendment issue before hearing the review petitions against the apex court decision of July 2024 in the reserved seats case. Also through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the SIC had requested the constitutional bench to postpone the next hearing of the review petitions scheduled for May 19 (tomorrow). Mr Siddiqi, who filed the application seeking reconstitution of bench, had also expressed an intention of challenging the composition of the 11-judge bench during the May 13 proceedings after which the court postponed the proceedings till May 19 to allow the party to file a formal application. Five major objections to the composition of the 11-judge constitutional bench raised In the fresh application, the party raised mainly five objections to the composition of the bench hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case. It highlighted that the July 2024 judgement was issued by a full court comprising 13 judges. It pointed out that the constitutional bench while taking up the review petitions comprised 13 members but later the strength was reduced to 11 members. It argued that the any judgement can only be reviewed by a bench having same numerical strength that the original bench had. Thus, the existing 11-judge constitutional bench could not review the petitions, the SIC reiterated. Besides, it argued, since the two dissenting judges of the original 13-judge bench namely Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Aqil Ahmed Abbasi had not recused themselves from hearing the matter, they could not be excluded from the review bench. It was a settled law, the SIC added, once a bench was constituted and seized of a matter on the judicial side, it could not be reconstituted in exercise of any administrative powers by the SC unless those members had recused themselves or there was some constitutional or legal bar requiring the reconstitution of the bench. Otherwise, it would amount to stifling the independent view of an individual judge, the party argued. “Any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, thereby eroding the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands,” the party emphasised. According to the SIC, if the two dissenting members were excluded by the present CB, then under no provision or principle of constitutional and statutory law, could they be considered a part of the existing bench by fictional irrationality making it a 13-judge bench and then again by fictional irrationality counting their dismissal decision at the time of final adjudication. “There is no principle of the constitution or law that allows judges, by fiction, be considered to be sitting on a bench, hearing and adjudicating a particular case without these judges being actually present during such hearings,” it reasoned. The SIC further argued that the July 2024 judgement was not delivered under pre-existing appellate jurisdiction as envisaged under Article 191A(3) and thus, the present challenges could not be considered review petitions to be transferred to the existing constitutional bench under Article 191A(5) of the Constitution. The review petitions must be heard and adjudicated by all the same serving judges who were part of the full court that delivered the July judgement, it emphasised. Also, the SIC argued that since the constitutional bench under Article 191A(6) had not formulated any rules regulating its practice and procedure, the SC Rules, 1980, Order 26 dealing with review jurisdiction would apply to the CB under which the review applications have to be placed before the same bench that had delivered the original decision.

      "description": "• Insists one of his biggest successes is persuading Pakistan, India to ‘step back from the brink’ • Describes his Gulf tour as ‘a major, major success’, issues another warning to Iran WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has said the United States intervened to prevent a possible “n-war” between India and Pakistan after the two nuclear-armed neighbours had already begun targeting each other with missiles and drones. Discussing the May 10 ceasefire between the two nations with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, President Trump described the situation as intensifying. “They were angry, and the next phase was probably — did you see where it was getting? It was tit-for-tat. It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles. Everyone was stronger, stronger, to a point where the next ones are going to be you know what: the n-word.” The Trump administrat­ion’s decision to mediate was repo­rtedly influenced by remarks from Vice President James David Vance. In a previous Fox News interview, Mr Vance commented that the con­flict was “fundamentally none of our business”. According to The New York Times , this statement “caused alarm in the administration that things could get out of hand if the US sat on the sidelines”. As the situation escalated, the US recognised that public statements urging de-escalation were insufficient, the reports added. Contrary to his earlier statement, VP Vance then called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he had met during a trip to India the previous month, stating that the US believed the conflict could lead to a full-scale war between the two nations, according to The New York Times . Secretary of State Marco Rubio contacted top Pakistani officials before the two sides established the foundations for a ceasefire. Following the agreement, Pakistan commended Presi­dent Trump “for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region”. India did not acknowledge the US role in the ceasefire. This is the fourth time President Trump has highlighted his administration’s role in defusing tensions between India and Pakistan, clearly ignoring India’s policy against third-party mediation. His remarks contradict PM Modi’s claim that the ceasefire was enacted on Pakistan’s request. President Trump, who wrapped up his high-stakes Middle East tour on Friday, covered a sweeping range of subjects in his interview, ranging from the tour itself to a $400 million personal gift from Qatar and record-breaking investment commitments totalling an estimated $2 trillion. But he insisted that “one of (his) biggest successes no one ever gives me credit for” was calling both Indian and Pakistani leaders by phone and persuading them to “step back from the brink” of a potential nuclear clash mere hours before his departure to the Gulf. President Trump, who wants to be seen as a man of peace, said this was a “bigger success than I’ll ever be given credit for”. India and Pakistan, he said, “are major nuclear powers. Those are not like a little bit. And they were angry. And the next phase was probably… you know what the ‘n’ word is, right?” He then lauded his use of trade incentives as a peace-building tool. “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” he said, pledging to reduce tariffs by “100 per cent” for US exports to India once full calm was restored. President Trump described his three-nation tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13 to 15 as “a major, major success” in strengthening US engagement with the energy-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. He attributed the success of the trip to his personal friendships with the leaders of the three countries. In the interview with Fox News , the network noted that Mr Trump created geopolitical shockwaves by lifting decades-old sanctions on Syria. His meeting in Saudi Arabia with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa was described by his officials as a turning point for the war-torn nation. Mr Trump also issued another warning to Iran, claiming that his sanctions policy had prevented Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. President Trump again defended his decision to accept a luxury jet worth hundreds of millions of dollars from the Qatari government to replace Air Force One, while also dismissing bipartisan criticism as a “radical left story”.

      "translatedDescription": "• Insists one of his biggest successes is persuading Pakistan, India to ‘step back from the brink’ • Describes his Gulf tour as ‘a major, major success’, issues another warning to Iran WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has said the United States intervened to prevent a possible “n-war” between India and Pakistan after the two nuclear-armed neighbours had already begun targeting each other with missiles and drones. Discussing the May 10 ceasefire between the two nations with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, President Trump described the situation as intensifying. “They were angry, and the next phase was probably — did you see where it was getting? It was tit-for-tat. It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles. Everyone was stronger, stronger, to a point where the next ones are going to be you know what: the n-word.” The Trump administrat­ion’s decision to mediate was repo­rtedly influenced by remarks from Vice President James David Vance. In a previous Fox News interview, Mr Vance commented that the con­flict was “fundamentally none of our business”. According to The New York Times , this statement “caused alarm in the administration that things could get out of hand if the US sat on the sidelines”. As the situation escalated, the US recognised that public statements urging de-escalation were insufficient, the reports added. Contrary to his earlier statement, VP Vance then called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he had met during a trip to India the previous month, stating that the US believed the conflict could lead to a full-scale war between the two nations, according to The New York Times . Secretary of State Marco Rubio contacted top Pakistani officials before the two sides established the foundations for a ceasefire. Following the agreement, Pakistan commended Presi­dent Trump “for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region”. India did not acknowledge the US role in the ceasefire. This is the fourth time President Trump has highlighted his administration’s role in defusing tensions between India and Pakistan, clearly ignoring India’s policy against third-party mediation. His remarks contradict PM Modi’s claim that the ceasefire was enacted on Pakistan’s request. President Trump, who wrapped up his high-stakes Middle East tour on Friday, covered a sweeping range of subjects in his interview, ranging from the tour itself to a $400 million personal gift from Qatar and record-breaking investment commitments totalling an estimated $2 trillion. But he insisted that “one of (his) biggest successes no one ever gives me credit for” was calling both Indian and Pakistani leaders by phone and persuading them to “step back from the brink” of a potential nuclear clash mere hours before his departure to the Gulf. President Trump, who wants to be seen as a man of peace, said this was a “bigger success than I’ll ever be given credit for”. India and Pakistan, he said, “are major nuclear powers. Those are not like a little bit. And they were angry. And the next phase was probably… you know what the ‘n’ word is, right?” He then lauded his use of trade incentives as a peace-building tool. “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” he said, pledging to reduce tariffs by “100 per cent” for US exports to India once full calm was restored. President Trump described his three-nation tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13 to 15 as “a major, major success” in strengthening US engagement with the energy-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. He attributed the success of the trip to his personal friendships with the leaders of the three countries. In the interview with Fox News , the network noted that Mr Trump created geopolitical shockwaves by lifting decades-old sanctions on Syria. His meeting in Saudi Arabia with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa was described by his officials as a turning point for the war-torn nation. Mr Trump also issued another warning to Iran, claiming that his sanctions policy had prevented Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. President Trump again defended his decision to accept a luxury jet worth hundreds of millions of dollars from the Qatari government to replace Air Force One, while also dismissing bipartisan criticism as a “radical left story”.

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: WWF-Pakistan on Saturday demanded that the proposed export of snow leopards from Pakistan to Russia be immediately cancelled and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the conservation of its iconic wildlife species. The organisation called for strengthening the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre to function as a dedicated facility for wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and veterinary care. “A move to transfer the snow leopards from Gilgit-Baltistan to Moscow not only contradicts national and international conservation commitments but also risks setting a highly detrimental precedent for future transfer of threatened and iconic wildlife species from Pakistan,” WWF-Pakistan said in a letter to the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination on the proposed transfer of two snow leopards, currently housed at the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, to the Moscow Zoo, Russia. According to WWF-Pakistan, the snow leopard is listed as a threatened (vulnerable) species on the IUCN Red List (2017), and it receives the highest level of legal protection under Pakistan’s national and provincial wildlife legislation. Body says no ‘compelling conservation rationale’ for transferring these animals Additionally, the species is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which strictly prohibits international trade except under exceptional, non-commercial circumstances. It further said there was no compelling conservation rationale for transferring these snow leopards to Russia, a country that already hosts a significantly larger wild population of the species. WWF-Pakistan recommended that instead of exporting the country’s unique natural heritage, Pakistan should demonstrate global leadership by reinforcing its commitment to conservation and the protection of its remaining wild snow leopard populations. It also highlighted the risk that once the snow leopards were transferred, it would be difficult to monitor or ensure the well-being of these animals under Russian jurisdiction. Remarking on the proposed move, Hammad Naqi Khan, WWF-Pakistan director general, said that approval of this export would undermine decades of conservation progress and significantly damage Pakistan’s standing in the global conservation community. This moment called for reaffirming stewardship of national biodiversity and strengthening the institutions responsible for its protection, rather than yielding to external pressures that compromised long-term conservation goals. “We need to uphold Pakistan’s obligations under international agreements such as CITES and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) by prioritising the protection of vulnerable and critically endangered species within national borders,” Mr Khan added. WWF-Pakistan said it strongly recommended steps to strengthen the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre to function as a dedicated facility for wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and veterinary care, equipped to manage future confiscations and care cases. It also asked for enhancing the capacity of the Gilgit-Baltistan Parks and Wildlife Department through targeted technical training, adequate financial support, and provision of essential operational equipment.

In Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear said early on Saturday at least 14 people were killed in his state. Kentucky, were starting today with the tough news that we lost at least 14 of our people to last night’s storms, but sadly, this number is expected to grow as we receive more information, Beshear said in a post on social media platform X. At least nine of the fatalities were in Laurel County, about 150 miles south of Louisville, when a tornado touched down just before midnight on Saturday, Sheriff John Root said in a social media post, describing it as “a mass casualty event.” There were numerous severe injuries, he said, and a search for survivors was underway. Aerial images posted on social media showed scenes of complete destruction in Laurel County, with entire blocks of houses reduced to splinters, and cars and pickup trucks left battered or crushed in the tornado’s wake. In Union County, near the Illinois border 250 miles west of Laurel County, a reported twister levelled mobile homes in the city of Morganfield, according to broadcaster WLKY in Louisville, but there were no immediate reports of casualties in that area. A man clears debris after a tornado hit in London, Kentucky on May 17, 2025. — AFP Earlier, officials said a tornado ripped through the Missouri city of St. Louis, killing at least five people and damaging 5,000 properties as it tore off roofs. It also knocked down power lines and swept through a major thoroughfare during rush-hour traffic on Friday, officials said. Five people were killed in St. Louis, and two others in Scott County, in southeastern Missouri, according to officials. “Our city is grieving tonight,” St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer, who was sworn in a month ago, told reporters on Friday night. “The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous.” St. Louis resident Joan Miller recounted her narrow escape when a tornado struck her brick house. “The wind started, the tree out front was shaking so violently,” she said. “And suddenly all the doors shut, the windows flew out from the bedroom … the entire back of my house … you can see straight into the alley now.” A spokesperson for both St. Louis Children’s Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital told NBC News that at least 35 people had been admitted to the facilities, with the children’s facility receiving 15 and Barnes-Jewish taking in at least 20, possibly 30, people who were injured as a result of the severe weather. The city imposed a curfew from 9pm to 6am in two police districts where most of the damage took place to prevent injuries from dangerous debris and reduce the potential for looting. The National Weather Service said thunderstorms were widespread across portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys on Friday. At least half a dozen tornadoes touched down in Missouri and neighbouring Illinois and other severe weather stretched all the way to the Atlantic Coast, including another tornado in New Jersey. As of Saturday morning, about 334,000 customers were without power, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks electric blackouts across the country.

      "description": "KARACHI: Business leaders have harshly criticised the Tax Ordinance Amendments 2025 , warning that misguided policies from within the government pose a greater threat to the country’s economic stability than external adversaries. “We request Army Chief General Asim Munir to keep a vigilant eye on the country’s policymakers who are bent on causing irreparable losses to the country,” said Nasir Khan, vice president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), during a press conference on the amendments held at the Federation House on Saturday. He was accompanied by other FPCCI leaders. Nasir Khan recalled that the army chief had assured the business community of safeguarding investments in Pakistan. “The enemy is not only on the border — it is also formulating destructive policies that are forcing investors and citizens to flee the country,” he added. FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon expressed concern over the sweeping powers granted to tax officials under the new ordinance, adding that under the amendments, a Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officer can penalise a taxpayer without due process, depriving the individual of the right to appeal. He said FBR officials have been given authority to recover amounts without issuing prior notice and to monitor industrial operations directly — moves that, he warned, would open floodgates to corruption. Mr Magoon questioned whether FBR officials had been granted a “certificate of honesty” to justify such unchecked powers. He criticised SRO55 and SRO69 relating to sales tax, pointing out calculation errors that are causing delays in the filing of sales tax returns. Additionally, he noted that in SRO55, the measurement units have been changed to kilograms, which would create operational complications for businesses. He also pointed to a contradiction in FBR’s approach: while a faceless system with no human intervention has been introduced for goods clearance, the Inland Revenue continues to create hurdles for taxpayers. Mr Magoon accused the FBR of pursuing its own policy in contradiction to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which is working to attract investors. “While SIFC aims to create investor confidence, the FBR is actively harassing them,” he stated. He reiterated national support for the prime minister’s vision to achieve $100 billion in exports, but said the FBR’s actions directly conflict with this goal. Mr Magoon also hinted at a possible new ordinance that would abolish the captive power option — a move he urged the government to reconsider. He pointed out that industries have invested billions in captive power and called for dialogue with stakeholders before taking such a drastic step. Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani termed the Tax Ordinance Amendments 2025 regressive and anti-business, warning that they pose a serious threat to Pakistan’s already fragile economy. He said the ordinance directly contradicts the government’s stated objective of providing a business-friendly environment. Mr Bilwani criticised the lack of consultation, questioning why such critical changes were made without parliamentary debate or industry input. He also condemned the excessive advance tax demands based on presumed income, calling it a flawed approach that ignores business cycles and seasonal fluctuations. He warned that this would hit small and medium enterprises and export-oriented units hardest, potentially paralysing their working capital and pushing many into default or closure. He noted that the ordinance criminalises procedural non-compliance, adding that even minor clerical errors or delays caused by technical issues could now result in severe penalties, heavy fines, or even criminal prosecution. He emphasised that the amendments do nothing to broaden the tax base. “Once again, the burden is being placed on those already in the system, while vast informal sectors, including retail, real estate and agriculture, remain untouched.” He also criticised the government’s decision to promulgate the ordinance via executive order, bypassing the parliamentary process. SITE Association of Industry (SAI) Chairman Ahmed Azeem Alvi urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to withdraw the ordinance, warning that its provisions undermine the documented economy, discourage compliance, and risk reversing the progress made in broadening the tax base. He warned that the ordinance would damage investor confidence at a time when Pakistan urgently needs economic stability. Published in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",

      "title": "Food import bill nears $7bn in July-April",
      "description": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s food import bill surged to nearly $7 billion during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, rising from $6.82bn in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher imports of edible oil, tea and sugar to meet domestic demand. According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, palm oil constituted the largest share among imported food items, followed by pulses, tea, soya bean oil and sugar. The value of palm oil imports surged to $2.87bn during July-April FY25, up from $2.30bn a year ago, reflecting a growth of 24.78 per cent. In response to escalating domestic consumption, Pakistan imported pulses worth $917.89 during the period compared to $687.74m in the same period last year, showing an increase of 33.5pc. The import bill for all other food items rose 0.54pc to $1.841bn in the 10-month period from $1.831bn a year ago. The imports of tea experienced a slight decrease of 5.13pc during the reviewed months, with its value dropping to $519.37m from $547.43m. Exports slip slightly to $6.2bn The import of soya bean oil soared 140pc to $279.63m compared to $116.60m a year ago. The US government has expressed its concerns to Pakistan regarding the import of soya bean oil, highlighting that failure to comply could result in a 29pc tariff on Pakistan’s exports to the US market. The import of milk, cream and milk food for infants grew 18.35pc to $103.32m in July-April against $87.31m last year. The growth in imports was recorded despite the tax introduced in last year’s budget. Export bill Contrary to this, the exports of Pakistan’s raw food exports fell slightly by one per cent to $6.16bn during July-April compared to $6.23bn last year, mainly driven by a decline in sugar and non-basmati rice shipments. The food exports have increased for 20 straight months, despite unparalleled food inflation in the country’s history. Because of supply and demand imbalances, consumers across the country are paying more for food items, particularly sugar, meat and poultry products. In the 10-month period under review, the overall rice shipments declined by 9.7pc year-on-year to $2.96bn from $3.28bn. This decline is mainly due to a drop in exports of non-basmati rice. Product-wise details show that the quantity of basmati rice shipments rose 14.8pc to 702,598 tonnes year-on-year and its value by 3.4pc to $722.71 million. Exports of non-basmati rice dipped 13.2pc year-on-year to $2.24bn. However, the export quantity dropped 2.05pc to 4.383m tonnes. Meat exports also dipped slightly by 1.2pc during the period. Vegetable exports fell 13.5pc, mainly due to falling shipments of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Fruit exports also dropped by 5.7pc. Fish and seafood exports recorded modest growth of 8.4pc during the period under review. Published in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",

      "translatedDescription": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s food import bill surged to nearly $7 billion during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, rising from $6.82bn in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher imports of edible oil, tea and sugar to meet domestic demand. According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, palm oil constituted the largest share among imported food items, followed by pulses, tea, soya bean oil and sugar. The value of palm oil imports surged to $2.87bn during July-April FY25, up from $2.30bn a year ago, reflecting a growth of 24.78 per cent. In response to escalating domestic consumption, Pakistan imported pulses worth $917.89 during the period compared to $687.74m in the same period last year, showing an increase of 33.5pc. The import bill for all other food items rose 0.54pc to $1.841bn in the 10-month period from $1.831bn a year ago. The imports of tea experienced a slight decrease of 5.13pc during the reviewed months, with its value dropping to $519.37m from $547.43m. Exports slip slightly to $6.2bn The import of soya bean oil soared 140pc to $279.63m compared to $116.60m a year ago. The US government has expressed its concerns to Pakistan regarding the import of soya bean oil, highlighting that failure to comply could result in a 29pc tariff on Pakistan’s exports to the US market. The import of milk, cream and milk food for infants grew 18.35pc to $103.32m in July-April against $87.31m last year. The growth in imports was recorded despite the tax introduced in last year’s budget. Export bill Contrary to this, the exports of Pakistan’s raw food exports fell slightly by one per cent to $6.16bn during July-April compared to $6.23bn last year, mainly driven by a decline in sugar and non-basmati rice shipments. The food exports have increased for 20 straight months, despite unparalleled food inflation in the country’s history. Because of supply and demand imbalances, consumers across the country are paying more for food items, particularly sugar, meat and poultry products. In the 10-month period under review, the overall rice shipments declined by 9.7pc year-on-year to $2.96bn from $3.28bn. This decline is mainly due to a drop in exports of non-basmati rice. Product-wise details show that the quantity of basmati rice shipments rose 14.8pc to 702,598 tonnes year-on-year and its value by 3.4pc to $722.71 million.

      "description": "LAHORE: Prime Mini­s­ter Shehbaz Sharif was cross-examined by the defence counsel in his Rs10bn defamation suit against ex-premier and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan on Saturday. Additional District and Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani conducted the hearing. PM Shehbaz and his counsel Mustafa Ramday joined the proceedings via a video link. At the outset, when def­e­nce counsel Muham­mad Hussain asked the prem­ier whether he had a copy of the suit, the latter resp­onded in negative and sou­ght some time to obtain the documents from his legal team via WhatsApp. The judge accepted the request and adjourned the hearing for a short break. As the hearing resumed, the defence counsel asked abo­ut the alleged audio reco­rding of late Justice Malik Muhammad Qay­um. How­ever, PM Sheh­baz’s lawyer objected, ass­erting that such a question could not be asked during the cross-examination. Advocate Ramday further pointed out that the high court had dismissed the def­endant’s right to file a counterclaim, therefore, no questions could be asked regarding the facts stated in that counterclaim. Asking about Justice Qayum’s alleged audio recording amounted to scandalizing, he said, adding that the plaintiff was not obligated to comment on that particular recording. The judge, however, remarked that it would be decided later whether questions about the counterclaim could be asked. At this, the prosecution said the questions raised by the lawyer of ex-PM Khan could be addressed during final arguments. Responding to the queries of the defence counsel, PM Shehbaz said he was unaware if Mr Khan had personally distributed posters or pamphlets against him, but he did know that baseless allegations were made against him on TV, which had a greater impact than millions of pamphlets. The plaintiff said Mr Khan had accused former premier Nawaz Sharif of offering him a bribe of Rs10bn through his brother. He explained at the time the alleged offer was made, his brother Abbas Sharif had already passed away, thus only he himself and his brother Nawaz Sharif were alive. In his defamation suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations against him. He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content. Mr Khan in his reply to case pointed out that the suit was filed after a delay of four years in 2021, saying one of his friends had told him that someone known to him and also the Sharif family had approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Mr Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama case. He disclosed it for the consumption of the public at large, he claimed, adding that an act in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation. He maintained that he did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (PM Shehbaz) while narrating the incident. The judge adjourned further hearing till May 24 to resume PM’s cross-examination. Published in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",

      "description": "WITH the Israeli Occupation Forces amassed in Gaza in greater numbers than ever before with a fresh reservists’ callout , an aid blockade that has extended beyond six weeks despite all international bodies pointing to hunger and starvation in the Strip, and an enhanced bombing campaign signalling stepped-up genocide, the military objective seems quite clear. Israel says its operation is aimed at securing the release of the remaining hostages. However, few could put the truth more succinctly than Mark Seddon, who has been consistent in calling out the apartheid state for its Gaza genocide exactly for what it is on X: genocide, ethnic cleansing and unparalleled brutality in living memory. “Only 8 hostages have been released by the Israelis [through military action]; 33 have been killed in their airstrikes, 148 have been released through negotiations. This is not about the hostages, it is about the annihilation of the Palestinians. When will the penny drop?” The apocalyptic images emerging from Gaza are beyond words. No adjectives work, they are indescribable. After the Holocaust in which millions of Jews were killed in the most brutal ways, the world said: Never Again. Clearly, nobody meant it. The penny may be dropping but it is already too late for 18,000 children, most of them below the age of 10. Notwithstanding its lip service, the democratic West, together with its media, is beyond doubt on one side here, having stripped itself of its humanity, ‘objectivity’ and ‘values’. The biggest success of the apartheid state is the demonisation of the Palestinians and the normalisation of their ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Whether a day’s death toll is 50, 75 or 100 it moves no one; or no one that counts anyway. Who hasn’t seen the live images: the bloodied faces and often limbless, limp bodies of murdered children, of their seriously injured, grieving mothers, of the patients bombed and incinerated while immobilised in their hospital beds, and of the despondent healthcare staff picking them up themselves and fighting yet another day of a losing battle to save lives without even basic equipment and medicine, that is if they themselves survive the hellfire unleashed by drones. The penny may be dropping but it is already too late for 18,000 children, most of them below the age of 10. Apart from the destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and civil infrastructure, and the restrictions on aid organisations, there is the barring of foreign journalists — who would have been more difficult to exterminate than the Gaza journalists all of whom were ‘Hamas’ — so that the outside world does not hear of the ethnic cleansing and mass murder, as that knowledge would eventually stir even the near-dead conscience of world governments. Yes, I say governments because I seriously doubt that the average man or woman either in the West — whose governments endorse the Gaza genocide as a legitimate exercise by Israel to safeguard its right to self-defence — or in the despotic Arab world — whose leaders have turned their backs on the Palestinians — approve of it. Despite draconian laws and powers being used by law-enforcement personnel from the US to Germany to the UK to crush/ discourage protesters, the images bear testimony, and protesters do surface in response to the call of their conscience. The Arab oppression is at another level and hence the silence on the streets. Months and months of images of emaciated and starving children , and of bloodied families and independent estimates putting the number of those annihilated now running into six figures, are making Western leaders squirm in their seats. Perhaps, their own hypocrisy is catching up with them as they constantly talk of ‘our values, humanity’ and then toss those out of the window in the case of the unarmed Palestinians. So, now Donald Trump, Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron among others are expressing concern over the food/ aid blockade of Gaza. The less said about the leaders of the Muslim world the better. Many of the most affluent, and thus, influential among them made a beeline to sign fat cheques unconditionally to earn the approval of the American president after welcoming him with fanfare. But predictably, they didn’t say much about the Gaza genocide. Perhaps, the US and Israeli media leaks ahead of the presidential visits were meant to ease the conscience of the hosts and enable them to welcome Trump with open arms, as media reports suggested serious differences between Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. But a picture of how diabolical plans are still in the pipeline to ethnically cleanse Gaza of Palestinians was provided by the US news network NBC . Even before Air Force One took off and was homeward-bound from the Gulf, NBC reported that it had learned of plans to relocate one million Palestinians to Libya alone from Gaza. This US plan, confirmed to NBC by four different sources, included incentives to the country afflicted by extreme lawlessness after ‘nation-building’ by Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy and David Cameron. Billions of dollars of its assets frozen by the US would be released to it. This must alarm European and Arab leaders alike. The Arabs ought to fear the street reaction to Nakba II , as even their iron hand may not be able to contain the outrage. European societies are already in upheaval due to the rise of the far right capitalising on fears of the continued arrivals of refugees particularly via Libyan shores. They should fear what may happen if a million forcefully displaced Palestinians, angry and desperate, do not wish to remain in Libya, the stepping stone via the Mediterranean to Europe, and even a trickle starts arriving on the continent. Imagine the destabilisation the far right will instigate and stoke. The handshakes of Trump and a battery of European leaders with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa who until recently led an Al Qaeda-aligned terror group and had a $10m bounty on his head, was evidence that the issue in Gaza may not be the ‘terror group’ Hamas but a commitment to the Greater Israel project. The West and the rest will have to decide whether it is worth it. The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",

Perhaps, the US and Israeli media leaks ahead of the presidential visits were meant to ease the conscience of the hosts and enable them to welcome Trump with open arms, as media reports suggested serious differences between Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. But a picture of how diabolical plans are still in the pipeline to ethnically cleanse Gaza of Palestinians was provided by the US news network NBC . Even before Air Force One took off and was homeward-bound from the Gulf, NBC reported that it had learned of plans to relocate one million Palestinians to Libya alone from Gaza. This US plan, confirmed to NBC by four different sources, included incentives to the country afflicted by extreme lawlessness after ‘nation-building’ by Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy and David Cameron. Billions of dollars of its assets frozen by the US would be released to it. This must alarm European and Arab leaders alike. The Arabs ought to fear the street reaction to Nakba II , as even their iron hand may not be able to contain the outrage. European societies are already in upheaval due to the rise of the far right capitalising on fears of the continued arrivals of refugees particularly via Libyan shores. They should fear what may happen if a million forcefully displaced Palestinians, angry and desperate, do not wish to remain in Libya, the stepping stone via the Mediterranean to Europe, and even a trickle starts arriving on the continent. Imagine the destabilisation the far right will instigate and stoke. The handshakes of Trump and a battery of European leaders with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa who until recently led an Al Qaeda-aligned terror group and had a $10m bounty on his head, was evidence that the issue in Gaza may not be the ‘terror group’ Hamas but a commitment to the Greater Israel project. The West and the rest will have to decide whether it is worth it. The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",

      "description": "IT’S not the best time for Pakistan’s Supreme Court. In fact, it may well be the worst in three decades. For now, we go to the latest chapter in its year-long surrender: the ‘ review ’ filed against the court’s last worthy decision , ‘Sunni Tehreek vs Election Commission’. To recap, the court had tried undoing the damage dealt to democracy by Qazi Faez Isa’s ludicrous bat symbol verdict , by returning winning parties their share of reserved seats. But that decision was ignored , the 26th Amendment passed, and the judicial branch carved into an armrest for the government. Battle over, the state is now clearing away the wood shavings: it hopes to overturn the Sunni Tehreek decision and secure the Sharif-Bhuttos’ artificial majority in the assembly. For this, the review petition is its weapon of choice. To be clear, a review isn’t an appeal: it’s meant to be heard by the same judges who authored the original verdict , which is why it’s usually thrown out. Even judgements wrong in law don’t merit review; that’s only for when an error is so wildly obvious, it can’t be ignored. Standing alone is still better than surrendering together. The bar is high for a reason: for the Supreme Court to be final, it’s more important that it have the last word than the best one — lest litigation go on forever, the law remain unsettled and chaos ensue. It’s worse still if final verdicts are reversed in days rather than decades: this signals to litigants that personalities on the bench, or politics beyond it, are in play; that it would be best to game the system instead. Hence Justice Fazle Akbar holding, as far back as 1962, that “a decision of this court should be reopened with very great hesitation and only in very exceptional circumstances”. But Justice Akbar could never have foreseen the era of Qazi Faez Isa (himself chief justice by the grace of a review verdict, mired in technicalities). Under the Isa court, the review became a way of life for rearguing entire cases, from NAB amendments to dissident voting . Some reviews were even framed as revisits, like lifetime disqualification. All succeeded. And all — whether one agreed with such reversals or not — had far poorer reasoning than the judgements they replaced. The state now seeks to do the same to the Sunni Tehreek verdict, via a review petition Justice Ayesha A. Malik has already seen fit to dismiss two Thursdays ago. Not that we could read her reasons: per new court policy still in the works, dissents or additional notes released before the final order won’t be uploaded. The worry is that the court may look disunited, or that debate may ensue. Only, that’s entirely what dissent is for in common law countries: to raise awareness of the law, and to encourage public debate. In fairness to the court’s conservatives, ill-timed orders have arrested democracy before: when the Bandial court was trying to enforce elections in 90 days, a string of unconvincing and incoherent dissents, primed to hamper the main ruling, stre­a­­med in. Then came the military trials case , with judges storming off the bench every which way, and the reserved seats decision, in which dissenters even cried against the judgement being implemented. But that’s hardly cause enough: the main verdicts in all such cases have aged well, in both the law and the popular imagination. If they were defeated, it wasn’t just by dissenting notes, but by the regime of the day going to war with the courts — no judge can enforce the law when the entire state apparatus refuses to. In which case, standing alone is still better than surr­e­­­­ndering to­­g­e­ther; disagreem­ents — written within the law — require publishing. Bec­a­use yesterday’s dissent may beco­­me to­­morr­o­w’s majority: Cor­ne­lius’s lone stan­­ce against brute for­ce in ‘Tamiz­­ud­din’ returned as a roar in Sindh High Court Bar Association. It can also expose bad logic, like justice Nasir-ul-Mulk’s dissent against acquitting those accused of assaulting Mukhtaran Mai. Most of all, it allows judges to uphold their conscience and object on the record, as justice Khosa did to military trials of civilians a decade ago. Finally, a petitioner deserves to know his argument was understood, even in defeat — that his day in court meant something. This past week, it was a two-man minority that sided with petitioner Jawwad S. Khawaja, and struck down military trials of civilians. And that made all the difference: it’s taken the combined might of the bogus procedure law, a so-called constitutional amendment , and a second bench formed by justice Isa, to upend the landmark ruling from 2023. Yet even after so much engineering, the final tally still stands at 7-5 — both verdicts taken together — 7-5, against military trials, within the same Supreme Court. May dissents continue.

      "description": "WITH South Asia’s peace balanced on a knife-edge, it is important for national political leaders to remain grounded. In this context, it has been encouraging to see a slight shift in Islamabad’s position on the recent hostilities between India and Pakistan. At the start of last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had described the recent conflict as having ‘ avenged ’ the 1971 war — a claim that had startled many even in Pakistan. Towards the end of the week, however, his speeches were more moderate, with the prime minister noting at one point that past wars had given the two countries “ nothing but miseries ” and that there now needed to be a comprehensive dialogue . It is encouraging that there is realisation on Pakistan’s side at least that grandstanding on the recent conflict is quite pointless, and that the frictions between the two countries still need to be addressed. Former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar had encouraged much the same in her recent remarks in parliament. Noting that India’s defeat was not a celebratory occasion, she had said, “We must all be unapologetic as a country that celebrates a ceasefire”. After all, death and destruction are never something to cheer. Arguably, it is better not to have a war than to win one. Our political leadership must not forget this. History shows that states benefit when they are able to escape the unending cycle of hostilities and focus on how they may coexist. Pakistan’s indignation is justified in that it offered India cooperation from the start, but was met with cold rejection. The people also cannot be faulted for celebrating their armed forces’ successful defence against external belligerence. At the same time, however, both Pakistan’s leadership and public must think about how future conflicts may be avoided instead of escalating to the point of all-out war. It is only fair to expect reciprocity from the other party. The Indian government must realise the folly of a violent confrontation with Pakistan every few years. War is not some theatre with which to keep the public engaged. For better or worse, the two countries are bound by a long border and a shared history and culture. India must realise that it is detrimental for its interactions with Pakistan to be dictated by New Delhi’s constant desire to establish its hegemony in the region. The recent hostilities have yielded little apart from establishing a dangerous ‘new normal’ that could see more missiles and munitions being traded in future conflicts. What tangible benefit can the people of either country derive from this? Instead of constantly evoking the spectre of war, the governments of both countries should work towards peace. The people of the subcontinent will one day thank them for it. Published in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",
