      "description": "• Citizenship amendment bill deferred, two others introduced • MNA flags delay in ADB-funded bridges on Kalam Road ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Friday passed nine bills, including a money bill that had been blocked by the opposition a day earlier. Only one bill — aimed at amending the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951 [The Pakistan Citizenship (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024] (Section 4) — was deferred. Meanwhile, two new bills were introduced by suspending the rules and were also passed. These were related to child marriages and trade organisations. Later, the proceedings of the lower house of parliament were adjourned until Monday. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb moved a bill to amend the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 [The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2024], commonly referred to as the ‘money bill’, which had been blocked by the opposition on Thursday. The treasury benches later managed to get the bill passed by a majority vote. The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2024 is already in effect, having originally been introduced last year in the form of an ordinance. However, since the ordinance is about to lapse after completing its constitutional period, it was mandatory for the government to have it passed by the assembly to continue its enforcement. According to the statement of objects and reasons, the bill is aimed at removing certain difficulties faced by taxpayers in implementing higher tax rates on income from federal government securities. It also seeks to rationalise the standard tax rate on the overall business income of banking companies. The government had faced an embarrassing situation in the National Assembly on Thursday when the opposition cleverly blocked the passage of the important money bill mid-process by walking out and pointing out a lack of quorum. As the number of treasury members was below the required strength, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah, who was presiding over the session, adjourned the proceedings. Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui moved a bill to further amend the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Act, 1975 [The Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024], which was subsequently passed. Another bill, introduced by Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi to amend the Extradition Act, 1972 [The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 2025], was also passed. A separate bill to amend the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951 [The Pakistan Citizenship (Amen­d­ment) Bill, 2024], also moved by Mr Naqvi, was passed as well. The interior minister also tabled a bill to amend the Naturalisation Act, 1926 [The Naturalisation (Amendment) Bill, 2024], which the house passed. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved a bill to amend the Civil Servants Act, 1973 [The Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill, 2025], which was also passed. Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan introduced and succeeded in passing a bill to amend the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015 [The Anti-Dumping Duties (Amendment) Bill, 2025]. Two new bills introduced Two new bills not included in Friday’s agenda were also introduced in the National Assembly. One, moved by MNA Sharmila Faruqui, aims to curb child marriages within the territorial limits of Islamabad. The second, tabled by MNA Ali Musa Gilani, pertains to trade organisations. Later, MNA Amjad Ali Khan drew the attention of Minister for Communications Aleem Khan to an urgent matter regarding the non-construction of 12 bridges on Kalam Road (N-95) under an Asian Development Bank-funded project initiated in 2013. He also highlighted the non-rehabilitation of a six-kilometre stretch of road that was washed away by floods. Despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s announced rehabilitation packages, no progress has been made, causing grave concern among the public. Published in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has offered India to sit for a comprehensive dialogue to settle contentious issues including Kashmir and joi­ntly fight terrorism, remi­nding New Delhi that the neighbouring countries fought three wars in the past and gained nothing but miseries of the people. “After settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony here on Friday. The ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks­giving Day), was held at Pakistan Monument and attended by PM Shehbaz, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) Gen Sahir Mirza, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asif Munir, Air Chief Marshal Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar, Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf, federal cabinet members, diplomats, the families of martyrs, sports personalities and showbiz celebrities, as the nation celebrated Pakistan’s victory in the recent clash with India. Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz said, “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.” India asked to sit for talks on Kashmir issue, water distribution, joint fight against terrorism He said a war between the two nuclear powers (Pakistan, India) could endanger the lives of over 1.6 billion people living in the Subcontinent. “If there would be nuclear tussles who will live to tell what happened,” he said. While reminding the world that Pakistan’s civil and armed forces had been on the front line in the ongoing fight against terrorists for a long time, he said, “If our armed forces had not engaged them (terrorists), they would have been roaming around in many other countries.” He also unveiled details of his late-night meeting with the armed forces heads on May 9 when India attacked three of Pakistan’s airbases . “After Indian attacks, our Army Chief Gen Syed Asim Munir sought permission to retaliate. His voice was full of commitment, courage and patriotism. Later, you saw that how Indian airbases in Pathankot, Udhampur and many other places were hit ,” he added. The next morning Gen Asim Munir called him to apprise him that Pakistan has given a befitting response to India and that India is seeking ceasefire, PM Shehbaz said, adding that Gen Asim Munir asked him if Pakistan military should accept India’s demand for ceasefire. The PM also said he was later informed through evidences that Pakistan had downed six Indian aircraft, including three latest Rafale jets. “Action of our Air Force with indigenous technology and Chinese planes and gadgets gave such a blow to India that the whole world was stunned how Pakistan achieved such technology silently. Our action demoralised enemies and boosted the confidence of our friends,” he added. Celebrating the victory, Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day) began with a 31-gun salute after Fajr in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute in the provincial capitals, followed by hoisting of the national flag at PM House, holding of rallies and ceremonies in all major cities. On the occasion, the PM in his message highlighted that India while acting cowardly attacked Pakistan on the night between May 6 and May 7, resulting in the martyrdom of innocent citizens. “We were forced to respond for the sake of these innocent citizens,” he said, adding that the world saw that within a few hours an enemy that was many times bigger came to its knees and the planes that India boasted of turned into ashes and became sign of a bitter lesson of history. “Our Shaheens hammered the enemy and gave it a befitting reply,” he said. The brave and professional armed forces of Pakistan effectively and fully responded in the language of the enemy and wrote a golden chapter in the military history and foiled the designs of the enemy. Later PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and Chief of the Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, visited Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Rawalpindi to inquire after the health of troops and civilians injured in the Battle of Truth against India. The PM also visited the residence of martyr Squadron Leader Usman Yousaf, offered condolences to his family, and paid tribute to the martyr’s services for the country and his sacrifice while defending the homeland. He praised the armed forces for their exceptional bravery, determination, and sense of duty during the battle. Published in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",

      "description": "• Over 70 Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes • Critical healthcare access plummets as WHO reports last Gaza hospital for cancer and cardiac care non-functional GAZA: US President Donald Trump said on Friday that  “a lot of people are starving” in the besieged Gaza Strip, where rescuers reported more than 70 people killed in Israeli air strikes since midnight. Trump’s brief comments on Gaza came as he capped the first foreign tour of his second term, which saw him visit several Gulf countries but excluded key ally Israel. A two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March, shortly after Israel reimposed a total blockade on Gaza that aid agencies say has sparked critical food shortages. “We’re looking at Gaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving,” Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi. Israel cut off aid to Gaza on March 2, a tactic it has said is intended to force concessions from Hamas, which is still holding dozens of Israeli prisoners it seized in October 2023. Hamas insisted on Thursday that the restoration of humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory was  “the minimum requirement” for talks. It also warned that Gaza was not  “for sale” hours after Trump again floated taking over the territory and turning it into  “a freedom zone”. On Friday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said that 74 people had been killed in Israeli strikes since midnight, reporting dozens more trapped under the rubble as shelling continued. The strikes sparked panic in northern Gaza. “We were asleep when suddenly everything exploded around us,” north Gaza resident Umm Mohammed al-Tatari, 57, told AFP . “Everyone started running. We saw the destruction with our own eyes. There was blood everywhere, body parts and corpses. We didn’t know who was dead and who was still alive.” Another resident, 33-year-old Ahmed Nasr, said the bombing continued through the night. “We couldn’t sleep or find any peace. There is no safety. We could die at any moment,” he said. AFPTV footage from the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia showed mourners crying over the bodies of their loved ones. The dead and injured lay on a blood-smeared floor, where medics treated those still alive. Hamas retaliated in October 2023 with an unprecedented attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Of the 251 prisoners taken during the attack, 57 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. The health ministry in Gaza said 2,876 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 53,010. Israeli media reported on Friday that the military had stepped up its offensive in Gaza following government approval of a plan to retake the territory earlier this month, though the army has yet to formally announce its threatened expansion of the campaign. A young Palestinian walks down the stairs of a home in Jabalia in the Northern Gaza Strip after it was destroyed in an Israeli strike, on May 16, 2025. — AFP The military said it was continuing its operations, adding that over the past day, it had  “struck over 150 terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip including anti-tank missile posts, terrorist cells, military structures, and operational centres”. Israel’s main group representing the families of prisoners still held in Gaza said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was missing a “historic opportunity” to get their loved ones out. The United Nations estimates that 70 per cent of Gaza is now either an Israeli-declared no-go zone or under evacuation order. Minimum requirement For weeks, UN agencies have warned that supplies of everything from food and clean water to fuel and medicines are reaching new lows. The World Health Organisation said the last hospital in Gaza providing cancer and cardiac care had stopped functioning after an Israeli attack on Tuesday left it  “severely damaged and inaccessible”. Israel says its aid stoppage and military pressure are meant to force Hamas to free the remaining prisoners. But senior Hamas official Basem Naim said the entry of aid into Gaza was  “the minimum requirement for a conducive and constructive negotiation environment”. Published in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",

      "description": "• FO says Islamabad’s restrained response reinforces deterrence, warns Pakistan will have no choice but to respond if India resumes hostilities • Insists govt remains committed to ceasefire • Indian defence minister signals aggressive stance, calls strikes a ‘trailer’ • Jaishankar reiterates any talks will be strictly bilateral ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday rejected India’s claim that recent military strikes had established a “new norm” in their tense bilateral relations, insisting that respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity remains the only acceptable standard in inter-state ties. The remarks by Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan came amid a fragile ceasefire agreed upon on May 10, following India’s Operation Sindoor (vermilion, a traditional symbol of marriage worn by Hindu women) and Pakistani response codenamed Operation Bunyanum Marsoos (Iron Wall). Pakistan condemned the strikes as a violation of its sovereignty. “While India propagates the notion of establishing a ‘new normal’ in bilateral relations, our restrained response has reaffirmed that the only acceptable norm is respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Mr Khan said at the weekly media briefing. “Pakistan’s effective counterstrikes have reinforced the credibility of its deterrence and dispelled any illusions of India’s conventional superiority or its ambitions to impose hegemony in the region,” he added. The ceasefire, brokered with US mediation, has held though tenuously. Mr Khan underscored Pakistan’s commitment, saying, “Pakistan, as a responsible state, remains committed to the ceasefire and to taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.” He warned, “Given India’s belligerent posture, we call upon our international partners to ensure that India honours its commitments and refrains from further aggression. Should India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond.” On Friday, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh described the strikes against Pakistan as “just a trailer, will show full picture if need be,” signalling India’s readiness to escalate, according to Indian media. Tensions were further complicated by China’s announcement to rename 27 places in Arunachal Pradesh, a region India claims as its own. India’s External Affairs Ministry called the move “vain and preposterous,” asserting, “Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India.” The Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman expressed support for Beijing, saying, “We have noted this development regarding China’s renaming of some areas within Arunachal Pradesh. Pakistan reiterates its consistent support for China on issues of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Mr Singh, in his statements, also urged the International Monetary Fund to reconsider $1 billion in aid to Pakistan, alleging it could fund terrorism. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he said at Bhuj Air Base. Mr Khan dismissed Mr Singh’s statement, stating, “India trying to politicise an institution like the IMF speaks about its desperation and frustration”. He also criticised India’s suspension of the Indus Wat­ers Treaty , a 1960 agr­eement governing shared rivers. “Holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance is unilateral and illegal,” Mr Khan said. “It is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy”. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has proposed talks at a neutral venue, but Mr Khan called media discussions on timing and modalities “premature”. “Professional diplomats are optimists; we are optimistic people. The government remains optimistic,” the spokesman maintai­ned. India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday insisted talks would be “strictly bilateral”, signalling resistance to third-party mediation. Published in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic courtroom session, another judge of the Islamabad High Court ‘defied’ a two-judge order, as Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan raised serious objections to a stay order in a contempt case initiated over the transfer of a petition from his court without his consent. The contempt proceedings, initiated against the deputy registrar and others, have now become the centre of a significant legal and institutional controversy. Interestingly, amicus curiae and senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui suggested to the court that contempt proceedings could be initiated against all concerned, including the judge, stating that even the judiciary was not above accountability. The contempt proceedings were initiated against court officials after the acting chief justice consolidated identical petitions related to PTI founder Imran Khan’s visitation and fixed them before a three-member larger bench. Advocate Siddiqui pointed out that there are precedents in both Pakis­tani and Indian jurisprudence where a judge issued contempt of court notices to another bench. When Justice Ejaz Ishaq Khan asked whether a judge could move the Supreme Judicial Council for being obstructed in the administration of justice, Mr Siddiqui replied that invoking the contempt law was also an appropriate course of action. Upon resuming the hearing, Justice Khan was informed that a two-member division bench had suspended the contempt proceedings. “You are telling this court that it has been stopped from conducting contempt proceedings? This is a serious overstepping of authority,” Justice Khan remarked, questioning both the legality and the basis of the division bench’s intervention. He reiterated the legal principle that an intra-court appeal (ICA) against an interim order is not admissible. “Didn’t the division bench also know that an ICA against an interim order is not admissible?” he asked. “This order goes against the authority of my senior colleague.” Justice Khan warned that such judicial overreach could damage public trust in the courts. “If I accept this overstepping of authority, why will litigants have faith in my court? Why would anyone implement the orders issued by this court tomorrow?” he asked. He also questioned the conduct of court officials, particularly regarding the lack of communication with his bench about the ICA. “Were you forced to file an appeal, or did you act on your own? Are you making a joke of the Islamabad High Court?” he asked the deputy and additional registrars. Despite the institutional tension, Justice Khan made it clear that he would proceed with the case. “I will proceed with this contempt of court action and write the decision. I will write whether the Chief Justice has the authority to withdraw the contempt case from a judge,” he asserted. The courtroom witnessed moments of intense reflection and resolve. “Let me make one thing clear — even if I have to sit alone and pretend that people are sitting in front of me, I will still write the order,” the judge declared, underscoring his commitment to judicial independence. In his written reply, Additional Registrar Aijaz Ahmed stated that appeals against interim orders in contempt of court cases are maintainable if such orders suffer from legal defects or jurisdictional flaws. The decision, outlined in Paragraph 10 of the judgement dated Feb 6, 2025, overturns a previous precedent and aligns with a ruling of the Lahore High Court, signalling a significant shift in the interpretation of contempt laws. The reply further clarified that interim orders can be challenged if they are “inherently without jurisdiction, void, or coram non judice” (decided by an unauthorised forum). The court criticised its earlier reliance on Indian contempt law, emphasising that Pakistan’s statute uses broader language — allowing appeals against any contempt-related orders, not just final or punitive ones. Advocate Faisal Siddiqui said the situation was creating the impression of a dispute among IHC judges. Justice Khan responded candidly: “There is a dispute among the judges, why should I pretend otherwise?” He concluded by stating that he would issue a befitting judgement and adjourned the hearing until June 12.

      "description": "QUETTA: The business community in Quetta on Friday condemned India’s boycott campaign against Turkish and Azerbaijani products and the cancellation of travel tickets to these countries by Indian citizens, calling it a reflection of frustration over support extended to Pakistan by Ankara and Baku during the recent conflict. Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Haji Muhammad Ayub Miriani, Senior Vice-President Haji Akhtar Kakar, Vice-President Engineer Mir Wais Khan Kakar and former QCCI president and business leader Haji Ghulam Farooq Khilji said that in light of India’s decision, “it is the responsibility of the government of Pakistan and the business community to come forward and establish strong trade relations with the brotherly Islamic countries — Turkiye and Azerbaijan”. “The business community of Balochistan is ready to play a frontline role in this regard,” the leaders said in a discussion at the QCCI, adding that they “hope the government will also take steps for stronger trade ties with both the friendly countries”. The business figures claimed that during the recent conflict, where Pakistan launched “ Operation Bunyanum Marsoos ,” India suffered “heavy losses” and is now “trying to cover up its failure by blaming countries like Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and China”. They contended, “The Modi government and the Indian public, in fear of Pakistan’s allies, are now boycotting their products and cancelling confirmed tickets to their tourist destinations.” They also emphasised Pakistan’s aspiration to expand global trade ties, noting that economic growth depends on international cooperation. “Pakistan aspires to have good trade relations with all countries of the world and is striving for rapid economic growth, which is not possible without expanding trade,” they said. The QCCI officials also said their organisation is working to resolve issues faced by industrialists and workers across various sectors, including import-export, agriculture, livestock and transportation. “We affirm that the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry will play a leading role in improving business ties with countries like Turkiye and Azerbaijan,” they concluded.

      "title": "Global acute hunger has hit new high: report",
      "description": "PARIS: More than 295 million people faced acute hunger last year, a new high driven by conflict along with other crises — and the outlook is “bleak” for 2025 as humanitarian aid falters, a UN-backed report said on Friday. It was the sixth consecutive annual increase in the number of people hit with “high levels” of acute food insecurity, according to the Global Report on Food Crises . A total of 295.3 million people endured acute hunger last year — almost a quarter of the population in 53 of the 65 countries analysed for the report. This was up from 281.6 million people in 2023, according to the report, which is drafted by a consortium of international organisations and NGOs. The number of people facing famine reached 1.9 million, more than double from the previous year, according to the report. A food security monitor warned on Monday that Gaza was at a “critical risk of famine” after more than two months of an Israeli aid blockade. “From Gaza and Sudan , to Yemen and Mali, catastrophic hunger driven by conflict and other factors is hitting record highs, pushing households to the edge of starvation,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in the report. “The message is stark. Hunger and malnutrition are spreading faster than our ability to respond, yet globally, a third of all food produced is lost or wasted,” he said. Conflict and violence were the primary drivers in 20 countries and territories, where 140 million people faced acute hunger, the report found. Extreme weather was to blame in 18 countries and “economic shocks” in 15 nations, together affecting a total of 155 million people. The deteriorating situations in Gaza, Myanmar and Sudan outweighed improvements in Afghanistan and Kenya. The report warned that the outlook was “bleak” for 2025 as major donor countries have substantially reduced humanitarian funding. “This is more than a failure of systems — it is a failure of humanity,” Guterres said. “Hunger in the 21st century is indefensible. We cannot respond to empty stomachs with empty hands and turned backs,” he said. The “abrupt termination” of funding in 2025 has disrupted humanitarian operations in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen, the report said.

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) on Friday requested the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench (CB) to decide challenges to the 26th Amendment before deciding the review petitions against the July 2024 majority decision in the reserved seats case. Moved through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the application has requested the court to postpone the next hearing of the review petitions, scheduled to be resumed by the 11-judge constitutional bench on May 19, until the apex court determined challenges to the 26th Amendment. The apex court was requested to fix, hear and decide the petitions against the 26th Amendment, which were admitted for hearing on Jan 27, before the review petitions in the reserved case. The application, which was filed under Order 36 Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 1980, argued that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), which constituted the constitutional bench, was virtually under the executive’s control. SIC asks bench to postpone May 19 hearing of reserved seats review petitions “It is apparent from the formation of the constitutional benches for last several months that the senior most judges of the Supreme Court have not been included in CB, thus the independence of the judiciary stands compromised,” the SIC said. The party reminded the court that the question of right to a fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution had been specifically raised in the challenges to the 26th Amendment. At the same time, the SIC also regretted that the review petitions filed against the July 2024 judgement remained pending contrary to the normal practice of the Supreme Court to fix the matter within three months of the judgement. There was a strong apprehension that the delay was deliberate on part of the then Chief Justice of Pakistan (Qazi Faez Isa) who perhaps was allegedly waiting for the 26th Amendment to the Cons­titution, the party alleged. The SIC further stated that underneath the constitutional mantle tailored with the fabric of 26th Amendment, there was an authoritarian regime hell-bent to destroy the judiciary’s independence, for its political objectives. The review petitions were transferred to the constitutional bench under Article 191A(5), inserted through the controversial 26th Amend­ment, which was in conflict with Article 10A (fair trial) of the Constitution and thus void, the party claimed. The SIC regretted that the only parallel in the constitutional history of the subcontinent of such a blatant manipulation of the judicial system through an amendment is to be found in the form of 42nd Amendment to the Indian Constitution, under which an unelected prime minister, Indira Gandhi, having lost the elections clung to power through bogus amendment. However, the Supreme Court of India rose to the occasion and struck it down in the 1980 Minerva Mills case, it added. The application pleaded that Article 191A(5), under which the difference between an appeal and a review plea has diminished, and also the jurisdiction of the bench to undo its July 2024 ruling in the reserved seats has been taken away was patently against the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. The SIC alleged that Article 191A was a “fraud upon the electorate” since the provisions was added specifically to undo judgements given by the SC to the dislike of the government that cobbled a majority to pass the 26th Amend­ment to perpetuate their rule without a mandate of the electorate. The application pleaded that since the 26th Amendment was passed by parliament that “lacked legitimacy and moral authority”, there was a patent conflict between the provisions of Articles 188 and 191A(5) of the Constitution.

      "title": "Police launch investigation as Ahmadi doctor shot dead in Sargodha",
      "description": "The police launched an investigation into the murder of locally renowned Ahmadi doctor, Sheikh Muhammad Mahmood, 58, who was shot dead in Punjab’s Sargodha on Friday. “We cannot comment on whether the doctor was targeted on a religious basis or for some other reason as it would be premature to say,” Sargodha District Police Officer Sohaib Ashraf told Dawn.com . He said one person was involved in the murder and the police were already gathering information after launching an investigation. The first information report of the incident was filed at Shahid Shaheed Police Station by a relative of Dr Mahmood under Pakistan Penal Code Section 302 (murder). It said the deceased was a practitioner at Sargodha’s Fatima Hospital and a renowned individual of the city. The complainant said he reached the hospital with the deceased around 2:35pm. The FIR stated that an individual wearing a uniform of the  ‘Saaf Suthra Punjab’ initiative approached the deceased and took out a pistol while saying: “I won’t spare you today Mahmood,” and shot the doctor two times in the back. It added that the culprit soon fled, with the relative following after him to catch him but the former turned his weapon on the latter as well. The FIR said that another person arrived on a motorcycle and two soon fled away. A press release by Ahmadi community spokesperson Amir Mahmood said the gastroenterologist had been receiving threats for a while from extremist elements, which had forced him to change the location of his job. “He was a very charitable person and had no enmity with anyone,” Mahmood said about the deceased, saying Dr Mahmood was a well-known Ahmadi and was receiving threats because of his faith. “The spokesperson said that this was the third Ahmadi to be targeted in the past month. The sudden increase in the continuous target killing of Ahmadis due to differences in faith is indicating a systematic wave. This is increasing the sense of insecurity among Ahmadis. This requires immediate attention and effective measures from the law enforcement agencies,” the statement said. The spokesperson alleged that extremist elements were active against Ahmadis in Sargodha for some time now, as in other areas with baseless cases being registered and hate speeches being made to prevent the community from performing religious rituals. “The continuous increase in hate incidents against Ahmadis is condemnable. The higher authorities should take notice of these incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice according to the law.” Two suspects were arrested last month for the alleged murder of an Ahmadi man and injuring another in Punjab’s Kasur district. Earlier in April, a 46-year-old businessman was lynched when a few hundred supporters of a religiopolitical party stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals, according to officials. In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan said it had observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship. The report , titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24 , said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.",

      "title": "We won the war but seek peace: PM Shehbaz invites India to live as ‘peaceful neighbour’",
      "description": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a “peaceful neighbour”, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’s success with a ceremony. The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack . On the night of May 6-7, India launched air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which stretched tensions. An American intervention led to a ceasefire. On Monday, the directors general of military operations held the first round of talks after the ceasefire. Today’s ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs. View this post on Instagram Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression. “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. “We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.” View this post on Instagram PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed “the last limit” and rejected Pakistan’s offer of an international investigation, a “measured response” must be given. He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan. “He told me, ‘Mr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it’.” The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: “We have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?” PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: “What could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy’s head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.” “This is a brief account of a long story from that day,” he said. He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. “This is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military’s prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan. The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan’s path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire. He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides. “The lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don’t think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis. “If we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky’s the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,” the prime minister emphasised. Earlier in the day, Youm-i-Tashakur began with special prayers in mosques, followed by a 31-gun salute in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute at provincial capitals, according to Radio Pakistan . The main ceremony of the day was also held at the Pakistan Monument. PM Shehbaz was the chief guest, while the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief were also present there. In a statement, PM Shehbaz said that the brave and professional armed forces have written a “golden chapter” in military history by giving an effective and forceful response to the enemy and foiling the enemy’s intentions, state media Pakistan Television reported . He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack. “In response to the enemy’s aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy’s military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,” the premier continued.

      "translatedTitle": "We won the war but seek peace: PM Shehbaz invites India to live as ‘peaceful neighbour’",
      "translatedDescription": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan won the war but sought peace and invited India to live as a “peaceful neighbour”, as the country celebrated Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’s success with a ceremony. The military confrontation between India and Pakistan began after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack . On the night of May 6-7, India launched air strikes on Pakistan, causing civilian casualties. Both sides exchanged missiles over the following week, which stretched tensions. An American intervention led to a ceasefire. On Monday, the directors general of military operations held the first round of talks after the ceasefire. Today’s ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), was held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad and attended by PM Shehbaz, armed forces chiefs, and other civil and military leaders. It began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs. View this post on Instagram Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression. “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression, he said. “We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.” View this post on Instagram PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed “the last limit” and rejected Pakistan’s offer of an international investigation, a “measured response” must be given. He detailed that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan. “He told me, ‘Mr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it’.” The premier added that later that night after Pakistan retaliated, the army chief had told him: “We have given a befitting response and now we are being requested for a ceasefire. So, what do you think?” PM Shehbaz said that he had responded: “What could be greater than landing a blow that leaves the enemy’s head spinning and desperate for a ceasefire? Go ahead and accept the offer.” “This is a brief account of a long story from that day,” he said. He informed the audience that the technology used by the Pakistan Air Force had stunned the enemy and sent the trust and confidence of allies soaring. “This is a historic development that God brought about within a matter of hours,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the military’s prowess was being talked about from the United States to Japan. The premier said no major power can now block Pakistan’s path, with the entire nation united from Peshawar to Karachi, standing behind and supporting the army. He also reiterated his gratitude to allied nations for their efforts in achieving the ceasefire. He went on to say that the conflict solved nothing, only bringing more poverty, unemployment and other problems to both sides. “The lesson is that we have to sit down at the table like peaceful neighbours and settle our outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. Without resolving these issues, I don’t think we will have peace in this part of the world on a long-term basis. “If we want permanent peace then we need permanent solutions of Jammu and Kashmir and water distribution. Then once we resolve these issues, the sky’s the limit. We can talk of trade, exchange of business communities and cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism,” the prime minister emphasised. Earlier in the day, Youm-i-Tashakur began with special prayers in mosques, followed by a 31-gun salute in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute at provincial capitals, according to Radio Pakistan . The main ceremony of the day was also held at the Pakistan Monument. PM Shehbaz was the chief guest, while the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief were also present there. In a statement, PM Shehbaz said that the brave and professional armed forces have written a “golden chapter” in military history by giving an effective and forceful response to the enemy and foiling the enemy’s intentions, state media Pakistan Television reported . He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack. “In response to the enemy’s aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy’s military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,” the premier continued. He also praised the leadership of Chief of Army Staff General (COAS) Syed Asim Munir and paid tributes to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and his falcons as well as the security of the maritime borders of the Pakistan Navy under the leadership of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.

      "description": "IF there was very one obvious lesson from the tumultuous week of conflict we have just left behind, it is that different nations deal with war in remarkably different ways. Ever since India began to sound the war drums following the Pahalgam attack on April 22, 2025, it was all snickers and giggles from the Pakistani side. Over on social media, where half of all battles now seem to be fought, Pakistanis devised memes and reels that mocked India and themselves. A favourite one was a reel of driving on a Karachi road in the dark, with the voiceover explaining the futility of bombing an already broken and wrecked city. Others requested that the attack take place when the gas supply was on so that there would be no way of serving tea to the invaders after 9:15 pm. Female Instagram influencers wondered what would be appropriate to wear during the war. Some forecast Eid celebrations at the Taj Mahal, others boasted of plots purchased in DHA Phase 13, located in New Delhi. Mirth and mockery made up the national mood. This seemed to be remarkably different from how things were across the border. Over there, the more familiar emotions that accompany an impending war were more in evidence, and there was anger, frustration, and fear of the future. The difference in the reaction itself, their own versus Pakistanis’, was something that seemed to surprise and shock the Indians. How could a country rely on humour and jokes to get itself through what were some of the most agonising moments in recent history? All sorts of upheavals have created a national understanding that worrying at the individual level simply does not matter. The responses to this question expose a crucial misunderstanding on the part of Indians. Unlike the Indians who have enjoyed a long period of peace and prosperity in their country, Pakistanis have endured a near-constant state of conflict for most of this century. Pakistan was thrust into the conflict when the US invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and Pakistan became a Nato supply route . From then until 2021 and the infamous, sudden and hasty withdrawal of the US from Afghanistan, Pakistan has been constantly beset by terrorist attacks. The tribal areas were no-go zones and the military was constantly carrying out operations in them. Terror attacks that killed scores forced people to endure unimaginable levels of stress on a daily basis for years on end. Terrorist attacks like the shocking and utterly inhumane one on the Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014 shred the nation’s emotional fabric. The tiny corpses that were carried out of the school in the aftermath of that attack are seared in the collective memory of the nation. All of this is to say that unlike India, Pakistanis are used to war because they have been at war for days and years. They have also developed strategies to cope with war. While writing this article, I had a conversation with Dr Yousuf Zakaria, a consultant psychiatrist in the UK. According to him, the Pakistani reaction tells a deeper story about war and survival. In his view, humour as a coping strategy in times of extreme stress and uncertainty is an iteration of ‘learned helplessness’ on a mass, national level. As he put it: “Learned helplessness is a phenomenon observed when people, after being repeatedly exposed to stressors they feel powerless to control, begin to internalise a sense of futility. Eventually, even in the face of danger or hardship, they may stop reacting with urgency or alarm — not because they don’t care, but because they’ve learned, consciously or unconsciously, that their reactions won’t change the outcome.” Humour then is a Pakistani survival strategy. Decades of political and military instability, the constant threat of terror attacks, unexpected school and work closures, all sorts of upheavals have created a national understanding that worrying at the individual level simply does not matter and will not affect the outcome. As Dr Zakaria put it: “Humour, nationalism, even defiant nonchalance can serve as emotional shields against helplessness. By making light of the threat, people regain a sense of agency — if not over the situation, then at least over how they emotionally experience it.” This is not to say that the trauma of war was experienced the same way by all. Those living in border areas saw explosions, shelling, and drones in a way those sitting in the urban areas did not. As a study by the National Centre for Post-Traumatic Stress in the US shows, civilians who are exposed to prolonged combat face many stressors such as the fear of being bombed, displaced, targeted, having restricted access to food and water and even being fearful of experiencing sexual violence. All these threats and fears have undoubtedly affected all those who live near the targeted areas, and especially the Line of Control . Every Pakistani knows that their worrying would have no effect on the outcome of the war. In deploying humour to deal with the build-up, onslaught and aftermath of the war they took control of their own emotional narrative. This allowed them to at least have control over their feelings even as they had little control over what Indian forces would do or even how their own forces would respond. Resilience is often the consequence of having endured significant and serious hardship. Pakis­tanis are resilient because they have borne so much, wars, pandemics, coups and everything else one can imagine. Last week’s national mood was a victory against despair and an example to the world of a country that is strong because it has end­ured so much and a people who can laugh — including at themselves — because they know crying will not change the circumstances or the outcome.

      "description": "THE planned import policy reforms to recalibrate tariffs in line with Pakistan’s industrialisation and export aims signify a major positive shift in the government’s economic and growth strategy. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has approved a roadmap to drastically slash average customs tariffs from 19pc to 9.5pc in the next five years, besides eliminating decades-old distortive tariff protections for carmakers , steel producers, textiles manufacturers, the chemical sector, and others against foreign competition. Another key reform focuses on reducing the number of existing custom duty slabs from five to four, with peak tariffs lowered from 20pc to 15pc. The roadmap also envisages doing away with numerous regulatory and additional taxes on thousands of imported items to bring certainty, transparency and uniformity to cascading margins. The reforms are expected to boost exports by $5bn once the adjustments are phased in, starting with the next budget. More importantly, the lower tariff barriers will go a long way in helping Pakistan integrate into the global economy with considerable ease. The tariff reforms should also boost our industrial competitiveness, and allow manufacturers to become part of global supply chains by giving them greater access to raw materials and semi-finished goods. Trade policy professionals generally agree that the high import taxes are a regressive form of taxation as they make businesses more inward-looking, thus creating an anti-export bias in the overall economic policy framework. Our tariff policy is a testament to that. For decades, we have imposed some of the highest tariffs, a major reason why Pakistan has failed to move to manufacturing high-quality, value-added goods. And regionally, its export-to-GDP ratio remains one of the lowest. High import tariffs and the inability to acquire goods that can support technological progress exacerbate the economic challenges. Indeed, there are concerns that lower tariffs, which Pakistan has until now used as a major source of tax revenue collection rather than for industrialisation and export growth, would lead to higher imports and, ultimately, to another balance-of-payments crisis. But such concerns are exaggerated and are being raised by those who have made money using tariff protections. There is no doubt that imports would rise but exports will grow at a much faster pace, reducing trade deficit and creating more jobs. However, the assumption that a reformed tariff policy can do the magic on its own is misplaced. Although Pakistan’s import taxes remain higher than its peers, these have come down considerably since the early 1990s when the country embarked upon the path to economic and trade liberalisation. Yet the fall in the average tariffs since then has not translated into proportionate export growth or significant integration into the global economy. This means there also are other policies that need to be fixed along with tariffs. Published in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",

      "title": "Analysis: Fragile truce — a pause or a path to peace?",
      "description": "IT’s been a week since Pakistan and India stepped back from the brink, agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire that gave both countries a much-needed sigh of relief after their most dangerous military standoff in over two decades, but instead of hope settling in, the moment feels fragile, weighed down by tough talk from Indian leaders, Pakistan’s call for deeper dialogue , and the complicated tangle of global politics that makes peace feel more like a pause than a turning point. On the surface, the May 10 ceasefire has begun to bear fruit. Military forces on both sides have initiated a phased drawdown and returned each other’s soldier that they had taken captive during these tense days. Meanwhile, the military operations chiefs held constructive calls on May 12 and 14, and another is scheduled for May 18. These talks aim to finalise confidence-building measures and a structured mechanism for de-escalation. Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan noted , “We urge India to adhere faithfully to ceasefire implementation. Directors General of Military Operations of Pakistan and India have maintained periodic contact since 10 May 2025. Both sides have agreed on a structured mechanism for phased de-escalation.” Even media management — a frequent accelerant of tensions — has been handled with rare discipline by the two sides [after the ceasefire]. DGMOs agreed to shield their discussions from media leaks, a significant step in avoiding narrative-driven escalations, a source privy to the talks disclosed. For Pakistan, stability means addressing root causes, not simply freezing the conflict, but the tone from New Delhi remains intentionally severe Yet, despite this progress, the tone from New Delhi remains intentionally severe. Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the ceasefire as a “temporary pause” and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reinforced that assertion saying, “ Operation Sindoor is not over yet … Pakistan is on probation.” This hardline rhetoric is aimed squarely at domestic audiences. With elections looming in key states and a national discourse deeply shaped by hyper-nationalism, Indian leadership appears more focused on optics than outcomes. Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow, South Asia Centre, Atla­ntic Council (Washington DC), observed, “Both sides appear to be playing to the domestic gallery publicly. They need to set an agenda under strict timelines. The agenda should meet both their needs. Endless rhetoric is not needed at this [stage]. [There must be] A clear vision from the top: PM Modi in India and PM Sharif and army chief Asim Munir in Pakistan.” Islamabad, meanwhile, views the ceasefire as a gateway to a more comprehensive peace process, with Pakistani officials willing to discuss terrorism, but insisting that Kashmir, India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty , and long-standing grievances must also be on the table. “Our focus is on stabilising the situation, consolidate the ceasefire and move towards de-escalation,” FO Khan said during the weekly briefing. For Pakistan, stability means addressing root causes, not simply freezing the conflict. This asymmetry of intent is a critical fault line. While India wants a narrow, security-centric dialogue, Pakistan demands a political one with regional scope. US played a central role in brokering the ceasefire, with President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading high-level backchannel efforts. Pakistan’s Army Chief General Asim Munir and civilian leadership coordinated closely, while Saudi Arabia provided discreet diplomatic muscle. Resistance from India India, however, has bristled at Trump’s repeated claims of facilitating the deal, though its dependence on US trade ties has tempered its reaction. This diplomatic tightrope reveals how global politics continue to shape South Asia’s trajectory. One of the biggest hurdles now is establishing a venue and mediator for follow-up talks. Rubio’s assertion that there is an agreement on holding talks at a neutral setting is facing resistance from India, which publicly rejects third-party involvement. The upcoming May 18 DGMOs call is critical. It must reinforce protocols, finalise redeployments, and reduce the risk of frontline miscalculations. Any failure here could unravel the gains of the past week. There is no shortage of risk — and opportunity. The May 10 ceasefire stopped the immediate bleeding . But unless both sides move beyond performative rhetoric, align on a realistic dialogue framework, and manage domestic constraints, they risk slipping back into familiar patterns of confrontation.
