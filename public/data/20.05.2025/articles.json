      "description": "This blog has now closed. You can read more of our US politics coverage here Full report: at least 50 migrants sent to El Salvador prison entered US legally, report finds JD Vance extended an invitation to Pope Leo XIV to visit the United States during a meeting at the Vatican on Monday ahead of a flurry of US-led diplomatic efforts to make progress on a ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine , the Associated Press reports. Vance gave the first American pope a letter from Donald Trump and the first lady inviting him. The Chicago-born pope took the letter and put it on his desk and was heard saying “at some point” , in the video footage of the meeting provided by Vatican Media. Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, also gave the Augustinian pope a copy of two of St Augustine’s most seminal works, The City of God and On Christian Doctrine, the vice-president’s office said. Another gift: A Chicago Bears T-shirt with Leo’s name on it. “As you can probably imagine, people in the United States are extremely excited about you,” Vance told Leo as they exchanged gifts. Leo gave Vance a bronze sculpture with the words in Italian “Peace is a fragile flower”, and a coffee-table sized picture book of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace. Leo noted that Francis had chosen not to live in them and added: “And I may live in, but it’s not totally decided.” Vance led the US delegation to Sunday’s formal mass opening the pontificate of the first American pope. Joining him at the meeting on Monday was secretary of state Marco Rubio , also a Catholic, Vance spokesperson Luke Schroeder said. The two then also met with the Vatican foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher . “There was an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,” according to a Vatican statement after their meeting. After greeting Leo briefly at the end of Sunday’s mass, Vance spent the rest of the day in separate meetings, including with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy . He also met with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Italy’s premier Giorgia Meloni , who said she hoped the trilateral meeting could be a “new beginning”. In the evening, Meloni spoke by phone with Trump and several other European leaders ahead of Trump’s expected call with Vladimir Putin today, according to a statement from Meloni’s office. Donald Trump ’s bid to gut the top US consumer watchdog has left the agency unable to protect consumers amid mounting fears of recession, according to workers. And we are on the verge of another major financial crisis, so it’s terrifying. The one thing we were created to do we can’t do – at a time when we’re most needed. We have helped millions of people. We have returned billions of dollars. It isn’t the way it has to be that there is nowhere to turn to when a bank or credit card rips you off. That is something everyone is exposed to. That’s what’s heartbreaking to me about the possibility of my job disappearing. Continue reading...",

      "description": "• PM praises Navy for ensuring maritime sovereignty • Reiterates Pakistan will give strong response to India if truce violated; lauds Trump for taking up Kashmir dispute ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday visited Karachi to pay tribute to the Pakistan Navy, which successfully safeguarded the sea lines of communication and ensured absolute maritime sovereignty through a layered seaward defence. During the visit to Pakistan Naval Dockyard, the PM was briefed by officials on the Pakistan Navy’s strategic orientation, operational undertakings, and contributions during the recent conflict . He praised the navy for its preparedness and said it would have given a robust response to India if the neighbouring country had tried to attack Pakistan using its fleet. In his address, the prime minister said India’s aircraft carrier Vikrant retreated after sensing the preparedness of the Pakistan Navy. “Indian Navy’s (aircraft carrier) Vikrant had reached close to Pakistan by 400 nautical miles, but after suffering immense losses inflicted by Paki­stan Air Force and Pakistan Army (elsewhere), Vikrant retreated, sensing the preparedness of the Pakistan Navy to respond vigorously,” he added. The premier also recalled the navy’s proud legacy of decisive operations, saying the naval force remained fully capable of executing high-intensity operations akin to the historic ‘Operation Dwarka’ (1965), whenever and wherever required. “Strong coordination am­o­ng the armed forces is a golden chapter in the country’s history,” he said, adding that the ground forces targeted the enemy’s positions with precision using Fatah missiles and other weapons. He also commended the Pakistan Navy for its resolute posture, operational dexterity, and effe­ctive deterrent response in countering adversarial maritime threats. The PM particularly praised the navy’s role in ensuring the uninterrupted flow of maritime trade. Lauding the role of PN, the prime minister said the navy was ready to give a befitting response to India if the neighbouring country dared to attack Pakistan from the sea. PM Shehbaz said that over the past 15 years, the Pakistan Navy has gained the latest technology. “I congratulate Pakis­tan Navy for the progress it attained during the last 15 years through indigenous technology,” he said. The PM reiterated that Pakis­tan was ready to give a stronger response to India if the neighbouring country violated the ceasefire . ‘Man of peace’ He also called US President Donald Trump a ‘man of peace’ and expressed confidence that the US president would play an effective role in resolving the Kashmir issue. “President Trump is a man of peace as he played a major role in averting war between the two nuclear states (Pakistan and India),” the prime minister said. PM Shehbaz said he wanted to express his gratitude to President Trump for his desire to play a “sincere role” for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute. He also thanked the leaders of Turkiye , Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Qatar , and China for supporting Pakistan. The PM said these countries supported Pakistan’s stance that there should be an independent and transparent inquiry into the Pahalgam terror attack and questioned why India was not entertaining the offer. Chief of Army Staff Syed Asim Munir and air chief Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also accompanied the PM, who was received and welcomed by the naval chief, Admiral Naveed Ashraf.

The premier also recalled the navy’s proud legacy of decisive operations, saying the naval force remained fully capable of executing high-intensity operations akin to the historic ‘Operation Dwarka’ (1965), whenever and wherever required. “Strong coordination am­o­ng the armed forces is a golden chapter in the country’s history,” he said, adding that the ground forces targeted the enemy’s positions with precision using Fatah missiles and other weapons. He also commended the Pakistan Navy for its resolute posture, operational dexterity, and effe­ctive deterrent response in countering adversarial maritime threats. The PM particularly praised the navy’s role in ensuring the uninterrupted flow of maritime trade. Lauding the role of PN, the prime minister said the navy was ready to give a befitting response to India if the neighbouring country dared to attack Pakistan from the sea. PM Shehbaz said that over the past 15 years, the Pakistan Navy has gained the latest technology. “I congratulate Pakis­tan Navy for the progress it attained during the last 15 years through indigenous technology,” he said. The PM reiterated that Pakis­tan was ready to give a stronger response to India if the neighbouring country violated the ceasefire . ‘Man of peace’ He also called US President Donald Trump a ‘man of peace’ and expressed confidence that the US president would play an effective role in resolving the Kashmir issue. “President Trump is a man of peace as he played a major role in averting war between the two nuclear states (Pakistan and India),” the prime minister said. PM Shehbaz said he wanted to express his gratitude to President Trump for his desire to play a “sincere role” for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute. He also thanked the leaders of Turkiye , Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Qatar , and China for supporting Pakistan. The PM said these countries supported Pakistan’s stance that there should be an independent and transparent inquiry into the Pahalgam terror attack and questioned why India was not entertaining the offer. Chief of Army Staff Syed Asim Munir and air chief Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also accompanied the PM, who was received and welcomed by the naval chief, Admiral Naveed Ashraf.

      "title": "Pakistan, IMF open talks on budget finalisation",
      "description": "WASHINGTON: Paki­stan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) opened high-level policy talks in Islamabad on Monday to discuss the upcoming federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, officials said. The current round of discussions, which will continue till May 23, will help determine whether Pakistan’s proposed bud­get meets the fiscal and reform targets agreed with the IMF under the Exte­nded Fund Facility (EFF). An IMF delegation arrived earlier in Islamabad for the formal policy-level nego­t­­i­ations on budget final­isation, after last week technical discussions held via video link amid heig­htened tensions between India and Pakistan. The Islamabad talks focus on revenue targets, expenditure controls, and budgetary projections as Pakistan grapples with mounting fiscal and external financing pressures. An agreement between the IMF staff mission and the authorities on next year’s budgetary measures and macroeconomic framework would lead to the announcement of the federal budget on June 2. IMF staff have emphasised the need to align budget priorities with programme goals of “restoring macroeconomic stability, building resilience through stronger reserve buffers, and advancing structural reforms for inclusive growth”. Positive trends One encouraging development is the turnaround in Pakistan’s external account. From a deficit of 0.5pc of GDP during the July-March FY24, the current account has swung to a surplus of the same proportion in FY25, mainly due to a recovery in remittances and relative political stability. These inflows helped offset deficits in trade and primary income, underscoring the economy’s growing resilience. Headline inflation, which had surged to nearly 40pc in mid-2023, dropped sharply to 0.7pc by March 2025. This dramatic disinflation allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut its policy rate by 10 percentage points since June 2024, bringing it down to 12pc by January. The easing of monetary policy is expected to support investment and consumption. Sovereign risks have also moderated. The continuation of the IMF programme and a more disciplined fiscal approach have led to a sovereign credit rating upgrade and a narrowing of international borrowing spreads, reflecting greater investor confidence. Challenges remain Despite these gains, Pakistan faces a widening external financing gap, projected to reach $19.75 billion in FY26 and stay above $19bn through FY27. By FY28, the shortfall could exceed Rs8.8 trillion. While foreign exchange reserves may rise to $23bn by then, “no significant income is expected from privatisation before 2030.” Remittances are expe­cted to remain steady at $36bn, while the current account deficit is projected to hover around $3.85bn. The IMF has warned of risks to Pakistan’s economic outlook from global developments, noting: “Risks to the outlook remain significant, including from global financial conditions, commodity price volatility, and geo-economic fragmentation.” It noted regional tensions as a key concern, stating that “renewed clashes with India could unsettle financial markets, deter investment, and distract from reform implementation.” The IMF has already put on the table its projections for major economic indicators, including fiscal and monetary policies, envisaging an economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent and average inflation of 7.7pc. This means the inflation rate would be significantly higher than the current year’s average of 5.1pc. The Fund expects Paki­stani authorities to continue to focus on expe­ndi­ture control, trimming it from 21.6pc of GDP in the current year to 20.3pc next year. But even then the exp­e­nditures wou­ld get close to Rs26.57tr next year compared to budget est­imates of about Rs18.9tr. The two sides have yet to work out the final numbers on revenue collection and revised exp­e­nditures, particularly tho­se that have ari­s­en recently due to the security situation. The IMF wants Pakistan to reduce its fiscal deficit from 5.6pc of GDP during the current year to 5.1pc next year. The government is also being asked to maintain a primary surplus — revenues minus non-interest expenditures — of around Rs2.1tr, a key condition for improving debt sustainability. Achieving this target is anticipated to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

      "title": "Smaller bench can review cases after 26th Amendment: SC’s Justice Aminuddin",
      "description": "• SIC wants dissenting judges be asked to sit on review bench in reserved seats case • LHCBA claims fresh oath to transferred judges ‘never discussed’ with CJP ISLAMABAD: Justice Aminuddin Khan, a member of the 11-judge constitutional bench (CB) hearing a set of review petitions against the Supreme Court verdict on reserved seats of the National Assembly, on Monday said that after the 26th Amendment, review petitions could be heard even by a bench smaller than the original bench. Even a smaller bench comprising eight or nine judges could hear the matter after the 26th Amendment , Justice Aminuddin reminded Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) lawyer Faisal Siddiqui who had earlier filed objection to the composition of the existing 11-judge constitutional bench. The counsel questioned how a bench less in strength than the original bench could overrule earlier decisions. Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail wondered if the Constitution or the Supreme Court Rules would prevail after the 26th Amendment, also reminding the counsel that no rules had been framed by the committee established under Article 191-A of the Constitution. The SIC lawyer argued that it was not the SC Rules but the jurisprudence rather the constitutional convention laid down by the apex court itself that the review petitions should be heard by the bench that should be the same in numerical strength as that of the original bench. The debate regarding the composition of the bench surfaced after the strength of a 13-judge bench, which took up the review petitions, was reduced to 11 considering that two of its members — Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi — dismissed the review petitions on the first day of the hearing. The original petition, moved by the SIC regarding reserved seats in the National Assembly, was decided by a 13-judge bench on July 12, 2024 . Two judges don’t want to sit on review bench During the hearing of the review pleas, Justice Amin claimed that the present 11-judge bench was reconstituted on the desire of the two judges who dismissed the review petitions since they did not want to sit on the present bench. Justice Musarrat Hilali added that the two judges had even declined to issue notices to the other side on the very first day of hearing of review petitions. The counsel said the two judges, who rejected the review petitions, could not be excluded from the constitutional bench. He said the two judges should be asked by the present bench to rejoin the hearing and if they still refused, their decline should be considered a recusal on their part. Mr Siddiqi also said the SIC had not challenged the integrity of the judges sitting on the constitutional bench rather the party objected to the “erroneous constitutional reading”. He reiterated the review jurisdiction principle that a bench with less members than the original bench cannot hear review petitions. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned how the two judges who had already dismissed the review pleas be asked to continue to hear the same. “Of all the 15 judges of the constitutional bench, the present 11-judge bench was constituted on the basis of available judges since two judges could not sit as they heard the matter in the Peshawar High Court (PHC) while the other two rejected the petitions on the first day of hearing,” Justice Mazhar explained. Matter of first impression Justice Mandokhail reminded that the present case was a matter of first impression, which whenever decided would define the future course. As Justice Amin remarked that the dismissal orders by the two judges would be counted in the main verdict, Justice Mazhar explained that Justice Malik, in her dissenting note, did not agree to the observation that dissenting judgement would be counted at the end of the hearing though “propriety demands that their dissenting order should be counted”. Justice Mazhar also wondered if the two judges would sit on the bench as a silent spectator, asking the SIC lawyer to come up with a practical solution to settle the issue. In response, the SIC lawyer, who had earlier challenged the composition of the 11-judge bench, said the matter should be referred back to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) for the appointment of two more judges to the CB to ensure the review bench has the same numerical strength that the original bench had. Objections to court priorities plea Senior counsel Hamid Khan, meanwhile, apprised the bench that the registrar office had objected to his application seeking court decision on the 26th Amendment before determining the reserved seats case review. He had filed the plea on behalf of the SIC before senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui challenged the composition of the 11-judge bench. He said the objections raised by the registrar office was that the SIC application was not just ‘sluggish’ but also ‘scandalous’. The case will be taken up on Tuesday at 11:30am. Judges’ seniority case Separately, a five-judge constitutional bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, postponed further hearing on a dispute regarding inter-se seniority among Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges for Tuesday. The counsel, who was representing the Lahore High Court Bar Association and the Lahore Bar Association, earlier claimed that the issue relating to the administration of a fresh oath to the transferred judges was “never discussed” rather kept away from Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and the chief justices of the relevant high courts when their consent was being sought for the judges’ transfer to the IHC. The bench suggested the counsel to furnish written formulations. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

In response, the SIC lawyer, who had earlier challenged the composition of the 11-judge bench, said the matter should be referred back to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) for the appointment of two more judges to the CB to ensure the review bench has the same numerical strength that the original bench had. Objections to court priorities plea Senior counsel Hamid Khan, meanwhile, apprised the bench that the registrar office had objected to his application seeking court decision on the 26th Amendment before determining the reserved seats case review. He had filed the plea on behalf of the SIC before senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui challenged the composition of the 11-judge bench. He said the objections raised by the registrar office was that the SIC application was not just ‘sluggish’ but also ‘scandalous’. The case will be taken up on Tuesday at 11:30am. Judges’ seniority case Separately, a five-judge constitutional bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, postponed further hearing on a dispute regarding inter-se seniority among Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges for Tuesday. The counsel, who was representing the Lahore High Court Bar Association and the Lahore Bar Association, earlier claimed that the issue relating to the administration of a fresh oath to the transferred judges was “never discussed” rather kept away from Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and the chief justices of the relevant high courts when their consent was being sought for the judges’ transfer to the IHC. The bench suggested the counsel to furnish written formulations. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

      "description": "NORTH WAZI­RIS­TAN: Four children were killed and five others, including a woman, injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan district on Monday. Sources told Dawn that the drone strike took place in Hurmuz village during day time, leaving four children of the same family dead and five others, including a woman, injured. The incident caused panic in the area. Locals shifted the injured to the Mir Ali hospital. Sources said some of the injured were in critical condition. Both security forces and outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan are known to have been using quadcopters. Area people, including tribal elders, youth and children later took to the streets after the incident and staged a sit-in at Mir Ali Chowk against the suspected quadcopter strikes. Some of them also carried placards inscribed with slogans against drone strikes. In a statement posted on social media, KP Minister for Relief Naik Muhammad Dawar condemned the attack and said the blood of innocent children would not go in vain. He said the attack was a crime against humanity and they would raise voice against it on every platform. He said they would also make all-out efforts to ensure that the culprits are brought to book. The KP minister said that they stood with the affected family and would extend every kind of support to them. While local authorities were investigating the incident, there was no official statement from the federal government on the matter. On the other hand, local elders termed the casualties a failure on part of the government, as North Waziristan was being targeted again. They demanded an independent commission to probe the attack. They vowed to continue their sit-in till they were satisfied with the outcome of the investigations. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

      "description": "ALI Khan Mahmudabad NEW DELHI: The arrest of Professor Ali Khan Mahmudabad on Sunday under charges that point to sedition and for hurting religious sentiments for his comments on operation Sindoor has been criticised by opposition parties who said the move shows how “fearful” the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is of critique, The Wire said on Monday. Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra said that if an eminent scholar like Mahmudabad can be arrested “on Mickey Mouse charges & jailed then it is only because of his name.” Ms Moitra also re-shared Mahuma­dabad’s post and said that nothing in it “is remotely offensive, let alone seditious”. Prof Ali Khan Mahmudabad has noted in his social media post that while rightwing Indians rejoiced at Col Sofiya Qureshi’s briefings about operation Sindoor, they were insensitive to the lynchings and bulldosing of homes of Muslims in India. Says move shows how ‘fearful’ BJP is of criticism The opposition also said that in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s India, “hate mongers” like Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah can roam free while those calling for peace are arrested. “The arrest of Ashoka University professor, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, shows how fearful the BJP is of any opinion, disliked by them,” said Congress president Malliakrjun Kharge in a statement on Monday. Mr Kharge pointed to the vicious trolling of Pahalgam terror attack victim Lieutenant Vinay Narwal’s wife Himanshi, who had called for peace and condemned the hate campaign against Muslims and Kashmiris. In Madhya Pradesh, BJP leader and cabinet minister Kunwar Vijay Shah called Colonel Sofiya Qureshi (who had conducted press briefings during Operation Sindoor) “sister of terrorists”, Mr Kharge recalled, and said that Mahmudabad’s arrest “follows a chain reaction”. “Instead of sacking their own Madhya Pradesh’s Deputy CM & Minister, who made disgusting statements against our valiant armed forces, BJP-RSS is hell-bent on casting a narrative that anybody who represents pluralism, questions the government or simply performs his professional duty in the service of the nation, is a threat to its existence,” said Mr Kharge. On Sunday, two FIRs were lodged against Mr Mahmudabad, one on the complaint of a BJP office-bearer and the other on the complaint of the Haryana State Commission for Women, days after its chairperson had summoned the professor over his social media posts against warmongering following the operation Sindoor against Pakistan. The police confirmed his arrest in a statement posted on X. Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha said on Sunday that “critiquing the government does not amount to critiquing the nation”. “Let us repeat a hundred times and if required keep doing it continuously that critiquing the government does not amount to critiquing the nation — and this is a crucial distinction in any healthy democracy or society. A government (however powerful it might appear!) is temporary and made up of elected or appointed officials whose duty is to serve the people,” he said. “Critiquing government policies, decisions, or leaders is often an act of patriotism, motivated by the desire to improve the nation and uphold its values. Loving your country sometimes means holding its leaders to a higher standard — because the nation deserves better. Therefore, to ask questions to those in power is not to abandon the land we love, but to guard it more fiercely — for a nation’s soul lives not in silence, but in the courage to speak.” Mahmudabad scion’s arrest comes as multi-party delegations will be sent by the union government to different countries to “project India’s national consensus and resolute appro­ach to combating terrorism in all forms and manifestations”. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP Asaduddin Owaisi, who will be a part of these delegations, called Mahmudabad’s arrest “utterly condemnable” and said that it “violates legal process”. “It targets an individual for his opinions; his post wasn’t anti-national or misogynistic. A mere complaint by a BJP worker made Haryana police take action,” he said. In a statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Sunday also condemned Mr Mahmudabad’s arrest and pointed to Shah roaming free even as the Ashoka University professor was arrested.

      "title": "‘India faked Shaheen missile attack to aid diplomatic blitz’",
      "description": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistani officials on Monday suspected that India triggered false alarm about the use of Shaheen missile during the military hostilities earlier this month as a deliberate fabrication, timed to support its post-conflict diplomatic surge and international lobbying effort. By exploiting fears of nuclear escalation, they suspect, India sought to redirect attention from its own aggressive actions during Operation Sindoor and reinforce its narrative of moral and strategic superiority. The Indian action, therefore, highlighted the dangerous intersection of disinformation and nuclear signalling in a volatile region. The baseless narrative, the officials, who spoke on background, argued is part of India’s broader strategy to frame Pakistan as a reckless nuclear actor amid mounting international concern over South Asia’s security volatility. “The claim that Pakistan employed Shaheen-class ballistic missiles during the recent crisis appears rooted in a broader Indian — and now Western — effort to frame Islamabad as having crossed a nuclear red line,” a senior official told Dawn . A video published and later quietly deleted by the Indian Army’s Western Command showed visuals of a Shaheen ballistic missile, sparking intense media speculation. Despite no official confirmation from Delhi, the video fueled allegations that Pakistan had used a nuclear-capable missile, even though no evidence supported such a claim. Pakistani officials, therefore, believe the Indian move was an act of information warfare aimed at influencing global perceptions. “The timing of this false narrative says it all,” the senior official stated. “It coincided precisely with External Affairs Minister Jaishankar’s diplomatic outreach to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, and with the dispatch of seven multi-party delegations to key global capitals.” The Indian intent appeared to craft a narrative of unity and resolve in the face of ‘terror threats,’ while stoking international fears about nuclear escalation. “Its objective is twofold: first, to recast India as a restrained power responding to nuclear intimidation; second, to portray Pakistan as reckless and destabilising — a complete inversion of the actual crisis conduct,” the official added. The Shaheen missile, a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads, is among Pakistan’s most potent deterrent assets. Any suggestion of its use in an active conflict would signal a dangerous escalation. Adding to the confusion, Indian media pointed to the Sarsawa Air Base as one of the Pakistani targets. Located over 400 km from the border, Sarsawa lies outside the range of conventional artillery and rockets, which some Indian analysts claimed as “evidence” of a longer-range ballistic missile being used. Sarsawa base is a critical facility in Indian strategic programme. However, Pakistani officials clarified that no Shaheen-class systems were deployed during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. The Foreign Office, categorically denying the use of Shaheen missiles, called Indian media claims “baseless and provocative”. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has firmly rejected the unfounded allegations circulating in certain segments of the Indian media, which falsely claim that Pakistan employed the Shaheen missile during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos (BM).” The FO statement emphasised that the operations, which targeted Indian military sites in response to India’s May 7 strikes on Pakistani and Azad Kashmir territory was conducted using precision-guided Fatah-I and Fatah-II missiles, long-range loitering drones, and advanced artillery. The Fatah series, with ranges of up to 400 km, are non-nuclear, guided munitions designed for deep precision strikes consistent with the strikes reported on Indian installations. “The recent conflict saw the effective use of conventional missile systems that met all strategic and tactical needs. Employing a strategic system like Shaheen — designed for existential-level threats — would have been unnecessary and doctrinally inconsistent,” the official, who spoke about the background, maintained ISPR described Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as a “textbook demonstration” of synchronised multi-domain warfare involving air, land, sea, and cyber forces. The four-day conflict ended with a US-brokered ceasefire on May 10. Experts view the false missile claim as a classic case of hybrid warfare which manipulated media and digital tools to seed doubt and provoke reactions. The FO noted the potential dangers of such tactics in a nuclearised region. “Disseminating unverified and inflammatory content not only undermines regional stability but also reflects poorly on the professionalism of official institutions,” the FO said.

The forecast for a heatwave comes on the back of a similar advisory issued on May 15. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), high pressure is likely to persist in the upper atmosphere during the ongoing week, with day temperatures soaring to four to seven degrees Celsius. “A shallow trough of westerly wave is affecting upper parts of the country,” the advisory stated, adding that the weather system is likely to persist during the next four days. Day temperatures are likely to remain 4 to 6°C above normal in Sindh, sout­hern Punjab and Baloc­histan during the forecast period. PMD urges citizens to avoid direct exposure to the sun from 11am to 4pm In central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khy­ber Pakht­unkhwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, the temperatures are likely to remain 5-7°C above normal. The advisory warned of dust storms and gusty winds at isolated places over plain areas due to excessive heating during the forecast period. The PMD advised citizens to avoid direct exposure to the sun from 11am to 4pm. “Avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and remain hydrated,” the advisory added. Farmers have been advised to manage their crop-related activities in view of the latest weather conditions and take care of their livestock. The heatwave in northern areas may increase the rate of snowmelt on glaciers during the forecast period, the PMD warned. Authorities have been advised to remain alert and take necessary measures to deal with any emergency during the forecast period. Over the past 24 hours, hot and dry weather prevailed over most parts of the country with isolated rainfall in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Potohar region, and GB, the PMD said. The highest temperature on Monday was recorded in Dadu and Jacobabad, where the mercury swelled to 48°C. In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, daytime temperature swelled to 39°C. The temperature is expected to rise to 41 or 42°C during the next four days. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

Authorities have been advised to remain alert and take necessary measures to deal with any emergency during the forecast period. Over the past 24 hours, hot and dry weather prevailed over most parts of the country with isolated rainfall in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Potohar region, and GB, the PMD said. The highest temperature on Monday was recorded in Dadu and Jacobabad, where the mercury swelled to 48°C. In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, daytime temperature swelled to 39°C. The temperature is expected to rise to 41 or 42°C during the next four days. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

      "description": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has received a prestigious global recognition from the World Health Organisation (WHO) for successfully eliminating trachoma as a public health problem, a major milestone for the country’s healthcare sector. The WHO award was presented to federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal during the 78th World Health Assembly in Geneva. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus handed over the certificate to the minister, acknowledging Pakistan’s exceptional efforts in eradicating the infectious eye disease. “This is a proud moment and a major achievement for Pakistan’s public health system,” said the minister. “It reflects our government’s commitment to safeguarding the vision and wellbeing of every Pakistani citizen,” he said. Trachoma is a bacterial eye infection that, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible blindness. Its elimination is a significant public health triumph that underscores the effectiveness of coordinated healthcare policies, community-based interventions, and international partnerships. Mr Kamal reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to achieving similar success in the fight against polio , stating, “Just as we have eliminated trachoma, we are determined to make polio a thing of the past.” The 78th World Health Assembly is currently underway in Geneva, bringing together global health leaders to deliberate on critical issues including pandemic preparedness, universal health coverage, and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, according to a spokesperson for the ministry of health. Mr Kamal is representing Pakistan at the international forum. He is also scheduled to address the assembly, where he will highlight Pakistan’s progress in public health, share key challenges, and outline the country’s future roadmap, particularly focusing on the eradication of polio.

      "description": "• 52 more Palestinians killed in attacks across territory • WHO says two million people starving due to blockade • Britain, Canada, France condemn ‘egregious actions’ GAZA CITY: Israel said on Monday it will “take control” of the whole of Gaza, where aid entered for the first time in more than two months as rescuers reported dozens killed in a newly intensified offensive. With the Gaza Strip under a total Israeli blockade since March 2, the World Health Organisation said the besieged territory’s “two million people are starving”. The leaders of Britain, France and Canada condemned Israel’s “egregious actions” in Gaza, opposed its expanded offensive and aid blockage, and slammed Israeli ministers for threatening the mass displacement of civilians. “We will not stand by” while the government of Benjamin Netanyahu pursues those actions, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a joint statement. Israel, facing mounting criticism over the humanitarian crisis, has announced it would let limited aid into Gaza and said the first five trucks entered on Monday, carrying supplies “including food for babies”. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement that nine trucks had been “cleared to enter… but it is a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, who was unable to confirm the exact number of trucks inside Gaza, said that “none of the aid has been picked up” at a designated zone as it was “already dark” and due to “security concerns, we cannot operate in those conditions”. Prime Minister Netanyahu cited “practical and diplomatic reasons” for the resumption of aid, saying that “images of mass starvation” could harm the legitimacy of Israel’s war effort. In southern Gaza, the Israeli military issued an evacuation call to Palestinians in and around Khan Yunis city ahead of what it described as an “unprecedented attack”. The call came after the military announced it had begun “extensive ground operations” in an expanded offensive against Hamas fighters. Gaza’s civil defence agency said 52 people had been killed in Israeli attacks on Monday across the territory. Netanyahu, in a video posted on Telegram, said that “the fighting is intense and we are making progress”. “We will take control of all the territory of the strip,” the Israeli leader added. The UN’s OHCHR rights office decried actions that are “in defiance of international law and tantamount to ethnic cleansing”, citing the latest attacks, displacement, the “methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods” and denial of humanitarian aid. Netanyahu on Monday said that Israel “will not give up. But in order to succeed, we must act in a way that cannot be stopped”, justifying to his hardline supporters the decision to resume aid. Famine risk Israel said its blockade was aimed at forcing concessions from Hamas, while UN agencies have warned of critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicines. “Tonnes of food is blocked at the border, just minutes away”, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “The risk of famine in Gaza is increasing with the deliberate withholding of humanitarian aid.” Last week, US President Donald Trump acknowledged that “a lot of people are starving”, adding “, we’re going to get that taken care of”. A group of 22 mostly European countries, including France and Germany, said in a joint statement on Monday that Gaza’s population “faces starvation” and “must receive the aid they desperately need”. Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir argued against any resumption of aid, saying on X that “our hostages receive no humanitarian aid”. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, also of the far right, defended the decision, stressing no supplies would be allowed to reach Hamas. “This will allow civilians to eat and our friends in the world to keep giving us diplomatic protection,” he said. Israel’s military said on Monday it had struck 160 targets in Gaza over the past day. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

      "description": "THERE are many reasons to be grateful that India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire . And while there are many sober considerations for this, on the lighter side, it will allow many of us hacks to step back from pretending we can offer thoughtful and serious takes on war, diplomacy and all matters defence. All this and more should be left to the difai tajziakaars (defence analysts) and retired ambassadors during private get-togethers, where everyone understands S400 , PL15 and integrated systems. And hopefully, the rest of us can go back to pontificating about who visited Adiala and why and how ripped — or not — the one page is, while the ministers and their PTI counterparts hold forth about May 9. This repetitive talk is in a way comforting as proof that we are back to our dysfunctional, insular ways on television and newspapers, where little time and effort is spared for the region or the world. But as we limp our way back into political (ab)normalcy, here is another week’s offering (hopefully, my last) on war and rickety peace. There has been much talk on the role of the media in this short conflict, where Pakistan in particular has ‘discovered’ how sane its media is, relatively speaking. So much so that officials cannot stop appreciating the media for its role in the conflict. But this tends to make old-fashioned souls such as myself uncomfortable, for the training of bygone days insists that only the unhappiness or discomfort of a government is proof of a job well done. Conversely, approval might suggest failure. Perhaps this adage does not hold true in times of conflict; for war is (hopefully) an exception, and hence the duration where usual rules need not apply is short. Still, constant praise of the media by officials is problematic. For they end up suggesting some sort of a link between what the press and media did and what the government expected. This is hardly appropriate. And though parallels and comparisons are odious, it is worth nothing that next door in India, the government has really not commented on the role played by the media there — although there were sections of the Indian media that not just created public opinion for an attack on this country but also broadcast news that later turned out to be fictitious about Indian attacks on Pakistani cities. The government’s approach in India maintains a distance between the fourth estate and the government which helps create credibility for the media, an essential attribute, if voices are to be heard and believed by an international audience. In the middle of all the noise, there has been some serious and nuanced commentary. However, this is not all. Watching snippets of the Indian media has allowed many of us, who work as journalists on this side of the border, to feel good about what we have at home — a sober and sensible approach. But in doing so we may be missing out on the variety and breadth the Indian media landscape has to offer. In the middle of all that madness and noise, there has also been some serious and nuanced commentary, which is missing on our home front. Take the superb interviews done by senior journalist, Karan Thapar , who is well known in the region and beyond. In a universe, where we are told only the godi media survives, Thapar has done a series of interviews which have provided critical and rich details on the conflict as well as modern-day India. He has even interviewed Pakistani voices such as Najam Sethi and Moeed Yusuf . Not only do his skills as an interviewer deserve praise, so do his courage and that of those who provided him with The Wire platform during these difficult times for dissenting voices and Pakistani views to be heard. This is why his interviews were avidly watched in Pakistan as well. As most journalists know, dissent is difficult when the vast majority of fellow citizens feel that there is only one corner to stand in when war beckons. I point this out as it is hard to name a similar platform in Pakistan which can provide similar dissenting and critical views. Or one that could interview voices of ‘the other’, if for nothing else but to understand their views and what is being said or debated. Indeed, while our commentary was far more sober, I am not sure we had the same level of variety or range. Other than journalists, there have also been experts who have spoken about India’s defence limitations publicly, a discussion we prefer to carry out privately. Is it always better that vulnerabilities are discussed in private? Or would doing so with some level of transparency help people gain a better understanding of the challenges ahead? While this will lead to comebacks about how The Wire and even other platforms have been and continue to be banned in India , it should still leave us with questions about why similar platforms do not exist here. These are issues to be discussed in Pakistan once the rhetoric and emotions have calmed down. For conflicts do not mean that those watching us will have forgotten the extraordinary challenges facing the media within in recent years. After all, till this crisis, X had been banned in Pakistan for over a year , despite court queries and questions from the people. And despite criticism, this ban continued. It was external factors that led to a change of heart . No wonder then that many users continue to expect the social media app to stop working just as suddenly as it did the last time. This is not simply the wish list of an old-fashioned hack; it is important for us all to remember that this war of narratives we are carrying out with India is not just to shape domestic opinion but also to carry a message internationally. The latter cannot happen without credibility; and this will not come about just because the government is happy with the media. The writer is a journalist. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",

      "description": "IT appears that the ceasefire will hold, at least in the near term. As Islamabad and New Delhi retreat cautiously from the precipice of a full-blown war , talks between senior military officials have continued to build on the groundwork laid by the Trump administration’s diplomatic intervention. The most immediate relief is that the two sides seem to have acknowledged that, their respective political leadership’s statements notwithstanding, the break in hostilities does not have an ‘ expiry date ’ and will be adhered to without a recurring need for formal renewal. Meanwhile, the DGMOs in Pakistan and India are in touch to ensure that the ceasefire can be made more ‘sustainable’. The Foreign Office spokesperson has said they have maintained periodic contact and agreed to develop a structured mechanism for de-escalation. This will likely involve a phased reduction of forward deployments and regular troops along the international border, with the Pakistan Rangers and India’s Border Security Force soon resuming normal operations. These are, of course, positive signs. A gradual return to normalcy will allow the two states to reflect on the recent crisis and, hopefully, find a mutually acceptable means to address its root causes so that the region does not find itself on the brink of nuclear conflict in the future. It will also provide the breathing space needed to dial down the rhetoric and refocus public attention on the bigger picture. One hopes there is some realisation by India that the status quo is not in anybody’s strategic interests, and that continuing to stoke hostilities instead of removing the irritants from the equation will only create more difficulties over time — not only for the two states but also for the South Asian region. There is a strong incentive for not allowing the feelings of heightened acrimony to linger and to reinforce the military drawdown with some soft measures. It has been encouraging to note that Afghan transit trade has resumed through the Wagah-Attari border. Sikh pilgrims, in particular, have been hoping that the thaw will lead to the reopening of the Kartarpur corridor , which New Delhi had closed , to allow Indian pilgrims access to the shrine of Guru Nanak in Pakistan. While officialdom deliberates and talks, there is no reason for the people to be deprived of the benefits of trade and spiritual pilgrimages. Public feelings of animosity for the other, made particularly worse by recent events, should be carefully calibrated down if there is a commitment to finding durable solutions to the existing problems. Allowing people-to-people contact can help immensely in this regard. Both countries have come very close to achieving a breakthrough on their issues in the past, and there is no reason that it cannot happen again. It may require a lot of hard work, but it is certainly not impossible. Published in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
